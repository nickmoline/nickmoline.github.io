For those of you who do not know this&#8230; I was married on July 2nd, 2006 in a small ceremony in my home. The question that a lot of you seem to have though is, why haven&#8217;t I posted anything about this wedding yet. The truth is I have. Barbara and I setup a special separate blog for the wedding which can be found at <a target="_blank" title="Nick and Barbara Wedding Site" href="http://www.molinefamily.info" class="broken_link">molinefamily.info</a>.

As many of you also know, it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted here on this blog, mostly because I&#8217;ve been busy with work, and getting ready for this wedding. Then after the wedding there was the honeymoon (a wonderful week in Vegas), followed by a week and a half of hard work. So I apologize for the long time it&#8217;s taken to get this post about the happiest day of my life up. For more information about the wedding and honeymoon, visit molinefamily.info to read the blog entries posted by both Barbara and myself. Yesterday I uploaded the pictures of the wedding to my photo gallery. Click the picture of Barbara and I to the left to see the full photo album.
