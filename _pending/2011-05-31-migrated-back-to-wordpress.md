<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-373" title="wordpress power" alt="wordpress power" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/wordpress-plugins-300x233.jpg" width="300" height="233" data-recalc-dims="1" />[Over a year ago](https://www.nick.pro/2009/08/31/nickpro-migrated-to-drupal/ "Nick.pro Migrated to Drupal"), I migrated nick.pro from WordPress over to Drupal.  I did this so that I could experiment with Drupal more, thinking I could make a more robust site if I did so.  Unfortunately, while Drupal is a fantastic, flexible platform for web development, it is simply not efficient as a blogging tool.

Drupal was so cumbersome to use as a blogging tool that I ended up stopping blogging altogether.  So for the first time in years of migrating this blog around and around, I&#8217;m reverting it back to a previous home on wordpress.

In the last year wordpress has come a long way, with lots of great new features that makes blogging even simpler then it was before.

I in no way mean to bash drupal, it&#8217;s still far and away the best CMS system out there for developing complex sites, but for a blog&#8230; it&#8217;s good to be home.  My hope with this migration back to WordPress is that it will lite a fire under me to blog again.  No more can I shirk my blogging responsibilities with the whine that writing a post in drupal is just too much work.
