I don&#8217;t know if the people from <a title="TH_NK - Strategic Digital Agency" href="http://www.think.eu/" target="_blank">TH_NK</a> read [my post about cheating](https://www.nick.pro/2011/08/27/pottermore-cheats-earning-more-house-points-through-failure-then-success-in-potion-making/ "Pottermore Cheats: Earning more house points through failure then success in potion making") on <a title="Pottermore" href="https://www.nick.pro/2004/02/22/plugins/" target="_blank">Pottermore</a> by purposeful failing at potion making, or one of the many other online forums posting about the issue, but a few days after my post went live, they posted on the Pottermore Insider blog that <a title="From duelling to potions" href="http://insider.pottermore.com/2011/09/from-duelling-to-potions.html" target="_blank">potions are being tweaked</a>.

Today [_Sara_ Moton commented](https://www.nick.pro/2011/08/27/pottermore-cheats-earning-more-house-points-through-failure-then-success-in-potion-making/#comment-309152302 "*Sarah* Moton's comment") on my previous post to say that they stopped giving a point for failing.  I have logged in tonight to test it and indeed, it is true.  TH_NK has fixed this logic flaw, and it&#8217;s great.<!--more-->

Apparently there was another way of cheating with potions that I never tried cause I presumed they wouldn&#8217;t base things on system clock.  In what some are calling the &#8220;time turner&#8221; cheat of potion brewing, you can simply set your system clock ahead and return to the potion page, and skip the lengthy waiting/brewing period.

I can&#8217;t personally verify that this was true, but it didn&#8217;t work for me tonight, so if it was, TH_NK has fixed this as well.

There is another form of cheating with potion making, that is not fully fixed yet.  <a title="Pottermore Cheats -- Ruining the fun of all 4 Houses" href="http://seekerrose.wordpress.com/2011/08/28/pottermore-cheats-ruining-the-fun-of-all-4-houses/" target="_blank">SeekerRose184 talks on her blog</a> about people purposely failing in the catastrophic way in order to purposely lose points.  The goal, nothing short of sabotage.  While the situation is being made better by apparently adding a <a href="http://seekerrose.wordpress.com/2011/09/04/pottermore-takes-action/" target="_blank">bottom cap</a> on personal house points of 0, it is clearly not a fix, and I&#8217;m not sure what they can do to stop this sort of sabotage.

Still, it is great to see TH_NK working to make Pottermore a better and cheat free place.  In addition to removing the free ride points, they&#8217;ve also finally <a href="http://seekerrose.wordpress.com/2011/09/12/potions-magical-points/" target="_blank">varied the points</a> on potion making so that harder potions are now worth more points.

I am still enjoying the site and am looking forward to seeing the site continue to grow as October approaches, and beyond.

I want to give an extra thanks to Spike and Guest who both let me know in comments on my previous post that there is in fact a way to send a message to the developers other then posting on my blog.  It turns out, in the <a href="https://www.pottermore.com/en/help#other" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Other section of the Help</a> on Pottermore.com, if you open up the What&#8217;s next? FAQ entry, there is a little link titled &#8220;Need more help?&#8221;  If you click this link (sorry it&#8217;s a javascript link so I can&#8217;t direct link it for you), you are given a small form that allows you to send a message to the developers.  Thanks Spike and Guest for letting me know about this.
