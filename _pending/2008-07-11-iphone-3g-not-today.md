But even at 6:30 p.m. (the phone had already been on sale for 10 and a half hours), the line was still stretched all the way around the Apple Store. I&#8217;m going to wait and hopefully pick one up next week when I don&#8217;t have to wait quite so long to get one. The line was so long NBC News was there interviewing people waiting in line.
