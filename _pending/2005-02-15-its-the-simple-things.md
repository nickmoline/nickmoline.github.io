I&#8217;m constantly being told I&#8217;m far too negative, that I focus too much on all the bad things in my life and not enough on the pleasures in life.

It&#8217;s 5:35 in the morning and I haven&#8217;t slept. In 4 hours I&#8217;m going to have to be at school ready to perform my first graded scene in Acting I class, then I will have to perform my first speech (Historical) in Public Speaking Class, then I will have to go straight to rehearsal where I&#8217;m expected to be off book, and then I will have 2 grueling classes of non-stop notetaking that will take me until 9 p.m., and of course, this is coming off of 2 weeks of some of the biggest pains in my entire life, passing a kidney stone, my favorite TV show being cancelled without any possible replacement for the first time in 18 years, and of course having my laptop being stolen. Yet in spite of all of this, I&#8217;m in a surprisingly good mood right now.

Why do you ask? Oddly enough, I&#8217;m in a good mood right now simply because I have fixed the annoying problem that has been plaguing my internet connection here at the house for the past couple weeks, and, on top of that, I just secured a job interview for tomorrow. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll get the job or not, but it&#8217;s the first real interview I&#8217;ve had in months, and it&#8217;s a start.

Also, I spent much of last night in a rather productive, if fun and silly, conference call between me, my girlfriend, and my business partner about the present and future of my business and my personal financial troubles. So, I am exhausted, and I have tons of work ahead of me, and tons of pain behind me, but I&#8217;m in a good mood, and that&#8217;s worth a blog entry isn&#8217;t it?
