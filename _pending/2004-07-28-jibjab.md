No, I didn&#8217;t come up with that title, my girlfriend told me about [JibJab.com](http://JibJab.com "JibJab") where there is an interesting political cartoon is currently being shown to anyone who wants to click it. In case they change their homepage, the link I just posted should go straight to the video, but be sure to visit their actual site at [JibJab.com](http://JibJab.com). Funny stuff.
