I&#8217;ve finally been to my first frat party. Thursday, Mr. E called to tell me had had a pair of paying sound jobs for me to do on Saturday if I was interested. I said I was. Friday night he e-mailed me that the second event was canceled but that the first event was still going on and I could make extra money there by staying through the whole thing instead of leaving early as I was going to have to do to do the other job. The first job ended up being the annual <acronym title="Brothers Under Christ">BYX</acronym> Island Party at <acronym title="Texas Christian University">TCU</acronym>. <!--more-->

<acronym title="Brothers Under Christ">BYX</acronym> is a Christian fraternity so the party was nothing like the fraternity parties you see in the movies, which I was glad for, because it would not have been much fun for me if it was. There was no booze or drugs, and the music was Christian. It was the music of course that I was there for, I was helping out Heaven&#8217;s Sounds Engineering in their task of running sound for the event. I was basically a roadie in that my primary responsibility was to set up and tear down for before between and after the concerts, but also whenever Mr. E needed a short break or had to go check on something, I did temporarily man the board when it needed to be maned so I did a little very simple sound mixing as well.

The party itself was fun, there were plenty of free food and sodas and the <acronym title="Texas Christian University">TCU</acronym> campus is really quite nice, really makes me miss college life, I wish I could be a student again, I missed out on a lot by giving it up so soon.

The first band was horrible, but the second band was pretty good and the headliner of the evening was [Matt Wertz](http://www.mattwertz.com/) who I was very impressed with, though I&#8217;ve never heard of him before. He had one song I&#8217;d really like to get a copy of because it really speaks to something I&#8217;ve had to think over a lot lately, and that is my testimony. Matt has a similar problem as me when it comes to sharing our testimonies, because well, My testimony is boring. I simply cannot remember a time I was not a Christian. I cannot remember a time in my life that I did not love the Lord, and this is a hard testimony to share because people seem to find a testimony boring if it doesn&#8217;t involve some massive conversion from a life of misery into a life with Christ. One of the songs Matt sung while he was there was a song called <u>All I Know</u> which is about this very problem, he too has known Christ his entire life. So, if anybody wants to buy me a present, [his CD with that song on it](http://www.awarestore.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=view_item&nav=music&Item_ID=9874&CFID=2000252&CFTOKEN=65703803) would be a very nice gift&#8230;.
