Ah another day, another bout of pain&#8230;. I am really wondering why my head is hurting so much lately, but it is really bugging me how much my head hurts at times. I cannot remember ever not having a headache in my life, but lately they have been really bad, I guess it must be stress. Have i mentioned lately how much I absolutely hate my job? Oh&#8230; I did, oh well, I&#8217;m saying it again anyway, I hate working for Metrotime!

My boss was complaining about absolutely everything today, even though I managed to accomplish not 1 but 3 major tasks today, which considering I&#8217;m the entire IT department of that company is a major accomlishment indeed, yet for whatever reason he was complaining about everything today, things weren&#8217;t working exactly the way he wanted so I&#8217;d fix that, then I&#8217;d go back to working on a major task, then he&#8217;d be complaining about something else and I&#8217;d fix that, and go back to the major task, so between fielding his whining and getting 3 major tasks done, I worked a very hard day for barely any gratitude at all! Oh I hope I can find a better job soon, or I think the stress of this hard work with little pay and no appreciation will end up putting me in a psych ward.

At least I was able to talk to D for a long time tonight, it&#8217;s rare that I&#8217;m able to get ahold of her and I do enjoy talking to her, so the few times I can talk to her on the phone are always a good way to lift my spirits for the day. Unlike me, she had a good day, however when I called her she said she was waiting for a call from her old boyfriend, so I&#8217;m wondering if that means she is getting back together with him, I hope not because I was really hoping to be her new boyfriend. Course I probably shouldn&#8217;t write this cause D is just about the only person I know who ever reads this, and I hope that if she does she won&#8217;t get mad at me or anything. And if she does&#8230; D, I&#8217;m so looking forward to visiting you.
