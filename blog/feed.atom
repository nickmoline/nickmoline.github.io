    <summary type="html">Working from home makes reliable internet essential, if the internet goes down for days I can&#039;t work, to combat this, I need to have another weapon at the ready....</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>Like many people during the pandemic, I've been working from home for over a year now, first for Justia, then for Ezoic, and now for Jobscan. One of the reasons I moved to Jobscan was because Jobscan offers me the opportunity to work remotely on a permanent basis. Barbara has also now gotten a job that allows her to work from home, though this may not necessarily be permanent for her.</p>

<p>One thing about working from home though, reliable internet is absolutely essential.  If the internet goes down, I can't reliably work, and neither can Barbara.  Unfortunately, as I'm sure you know, no Internet Service Provider, even a Business ISP, has perfect uptime.  Residential ISPs are even less reliable than business ones, and everyone dreads seeing that "Unable to connect to the Internet" error message when they are trying to get their work done.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/chrome-offline.webp" alt="Unable to connect to the Internet" width="800" height="343" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/chrome-offline.png" alt="Unable to connect to the Internet" width="800" height="343" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>As internet is essential for the job, one of the <a href="https://www.jobscan.co/careers">perks</a> Jobscan offers is a monthly $50 reimbursement to help offset internet costs for employees who are working from home. My original thought when taking the job was "that's awesome, that's like half of my internet bill," but when our ISP had an 8 hour outage one workday, I thought of another idea that would be a better use of that $50, a second broadband internet service.</p>

<p>That particular day I used tethering off my phone in order to work, but if this were to happen a lot, tethering was not going to be good enough, especially with both Barbara and myself working remotely. Last week, the internet went down again, this time for 2 whole days, and after it had been down for hours and a tech not able to come till the next day, I decided enough was enough and the time had come to get a backup internet service.</p>

<p>In businesses, having multiple broadband internet services is fairly common.  At Justia's Mountain View Office, there was a time when we had 3 broadband internet services: Cable from Comcast, DSL from AT&amp;T, and a T1 line from Telepacific (we actually had 2 T1 lines from them, but one was entirely voice).</p>

<p>That first day of the 2 day outage, I contacted Cox (the local cable company) and setup service on their $49.99 a month plan (150 megabit download, 15 megabit upload).  This is considerably slower than the Fibre connection I have with <a href="https://www.consolidatedsmart.com/axis-2300">Consolidated Smart Systems</a> (940 megabit download, 940 megabit upload), but as a backup connection it will do nicely.  I swung by the local Cox office to pick up a cable modem, brought it home and hooked it up to the previously unused cable jack in the apartment.  For that particular outage, I could just connect to the wifi that comes with the cable modem and use it till my main internet was back up, but I knew that going forward I was going to want a more automated system.</p>

<p>Business network routers, such as those <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/adaptive-security-appliance-asa-software/index.html">popularized by Cisco</a> often support multiple WAN connections, but it is rare to see a residential network router that could support multiple high-speed internet services at once (<em>some support hooking up a usb cellular internet dongle, but not 2 full fledged broadband services</em>), in fact I couldn't find one.</p>

<p>The problem of course is that most of these business routers are quite expensive, designed to fill the needs of entire offices they can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a router that will support connecting to multiple internet services and either load balancing connections or handling an automatic failover in the event the primary connection goes down.</p>

<p>I could create my own router using a linux box with 3 gigabit network cards, but making one that would robustly handle our connections would still be costly to setup and run. Not sure what I was going to do, I decided to see if I could find an affordable dual-wan router I could setup in my apartment that would handle most of the functionality I needed.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/tp-link-safestream-multi-wan-router.webp" alt="TL-R605 SafeStream Multi-WAN VPN Router" width="3859" height="2170" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/tp-link-safestream-multi-wan-router.jpg" alt="TL-R605 SafeStream Multi-WAN VPN Router" width="3859" height="2170" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>To my absolute amazement, I found a router that not only could handle this with 2 WAN connections, but up to 4 WAN connections, while also supporting a lot of the other features typically found in much more expensive business routers, for only <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QTXNWZ1/">$59.99 on Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/business-networking/omada-sdn-router/tl-r605/">TL-R605 SafeStream Multi-WAN VPN Router</a> from tp-link is a shockingly good small business router for the price.</p>

<p>The device has a total of 5 gigabit ethernet ports on it.  The first one is dedicated to the first WAN connection, and the last one is dedicated to a LAN connection.  The remaining 3 ports can be switched between either WAN or LAN depending on your needs allowing connections to up to 4 separate internet providers, which can be setup in a variety of different ways (load balanced, failover, combined) which made it nearly perfect for my setup.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/TL-R605-ports.webp" alt="TL-R605 Configurable WAN/LAN ports" width="1000" height="1000" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/TL-R605-ports.jpg" alt="TL-R605 Configurable WAN/LAN ports" width="1000" height="1000" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>I have 4 ethernet ports in the apartment wired up (one in each of the 3 bedrooms, and one in the living room), so since I'd only have 3 LAN ports on this router, I needed a small switch to wire up them all.  So I picked up tp-link's 5-port <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/business-networking/easy-smart-switch/tl-sg105e/">TL-SG105E</a> as well for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N0OHEMA">$22.39 on Amazon</a> which solves that problem.</p>

<p>With some relatively simple configuration, I now have the router configured to normally route me through the gigabit connection, but monitor that connection to make sure it says online.  If the connection is detected as going offline, the router will automatically switch everyone in the apartment over to the slower (but presumably still online) cable connection.  At what point it detects that the main connection is back online, it will automatically switch back to the faster connection.</p>

<p>I've simulated these outages several different ways and the most I spend offline is about 20 seconds, which is very reasonable for me.</p>

<h2>Other functionality of the TL-R605</h2>

<p>I mentioned before that the TL-R605 was surprisingly feature rich.  While the multi-WAN support was my primary draw to the device, I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of other traditionally business related features are there as well, and I'll make use of a lot of them.</p>

<h3>VPN</h3>

<p>The TL-R605 supports up to 68 concurrent VPN connections, many of which can be LAN-to-LAN, allowing for seamless connection of networks in multiple locations into a single large network.  It supports 16 connections using <a href="https://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a>, with an additional 16 connections using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_2_Tunneling_Protocol">L2TP</a> and 16 connections using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Tunneling_Protocol">PPTP</a>.  On top of all that, an additional 20 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec">IPsec</a> connections in either Client-to-LAN or LAN-to-LAN modes are supported.</p>

<p>IPsec is particularly interesting as traditionally IPsec is expensive to license, and even expensive routers often don't support all 4 of these protocols at the same time.  I will certainly be setting up both inbound and outbound VPN connections to give me flexibility, making external resources available to me, as well as giving me a way to connect home when I'm outside of the home.</p>

<h3>VLAN and VLAN Routing</h3>

<p>A common feature on expensive business routers is the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">Virtual LAN</a>, the idea of running multiple isolated network environments over the same physical network and handling each of them differently.  Individual clients can specify which VLAN they want to be a part of by specifying a number between 1 and 4094, and you can also configure specific ports on either the router OR smart network switches (like the previously mentioned TL-SG105E) to force users onto a specific VLAN automatically.</p>

<p>Having isolation can increase security as well as network throughput, especially when dealing with a broadcast situation.  Some devices send out messages to an entire network at once, meaning any time those devices are broadcasting, it impacts the bandwidth of all other devices on the network.  By isolating these devices onto a specific VLAN, I can ensure that broadcast messages from those devices only go to the other devices in the same VLAN, freeing up valuable bandwidth on other network ports.</p>

<p>Different VLANs can also have their routing be different.  You can have a VLAN that doesn't access the internet at all, you can have a VLAN that can access the internet and other devices on the network, you can have a VLAN that only can access the internet without giving them access to the rest of the network.</p>

<p>Even more exciting you can have different VLANs routed through the different WANs by default.  For example, I have a lot of IoT devices in my apartment, these need access to the internet but don't need the high speeds that my computers do.  To free up a little internet bandwidth on my main internet connection I can configure the IoT devices to go out through the slower internet connection by default even if the main internet is online.  Doing so actually is better both for computers AND the IoT devices.</p>

<h3>Guest Networks with Captive Portal</h3>

<p>If you have a wireless access point that supports VLANs for internal vs guest connections, I can also handle that through the main router.  This isn't a particularly high priority for me right now as I have no guests coming by my home during the pandemic, but eventually I am likely to look into replacing my wifi with an access point that supports this, such as the companion devices from tp-link such as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PW34WPX/">EAP660 HD</a> which also supports the newer WiFi 6 standard.  When I do, this router supports setting up a captive portal where guests can't simply connect to an open wifi, but have to authenticate using some means or another.  I can setup the captive portal to allow many different methods of authenticating, including using facebook login to authenticate.</p>

<h2>Staying Online</h2>

<p>I am extremely happy with this device and my now much more robust network setup at home.  There are still things I want to do to improve my network setup (starting with cleaning up the rats nest of wires that was left by the previous tenant).</p>

<p>I'd like to setup a full internal server for my home, perhaps even a cluster I can run <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">K8s</a> on and push an internal cluster of containers for development and management.</p>

<p>I am already running my own internal DNS server that doesn't call up to my ISPs dns server within the home.  This is currently running on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi 4</a> but I'd like to increase to a more powerful home server in the future.</p>

<p>I'd also like to pick up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply">Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)</a> for my network closet, so that a short power outage won't result in all the devices having to reboot and spend the several minutes to boot up again.</p>

    <summary type="html">For the latest show I&#039;ve worked on, I had an unusual new challenge, could I turn someone into a Harpy in real time?  How about turning a woman into a rainbow?...</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>In my <a href="2021-03-04-learning-behind-the-stage">last post</a>, I mentioned that with each show I work on, I like to learn something new.  I teased that I had some very unique challenges on this latest show <em>The Tempest</em>.  In particular I needed to create a number of real-time visual effects.  I used a variety of tools to accomplish this task.</p>

<p><em>The Tempest</em> is a show that is known for involving quite a lot of spectacle and translating that spectacle to a real-time production over zoom was always going to be a challenge.  In this post I'll break down a few of these effects including the tools I used to make them.</p>

<h2>The Harpy</h2>

<p>In <em>The Tempest</em>, there is a scene where the spirit Ariel appears in the form of a harpy in order to frighten and shame the king and his party for what they did to Prospero in the past (<em>spoiler alert for a 410 year old play</em>).  In the scenes immediately prior and following this, Ariel appears not as a harpy but as their normal spirit self.</p>

<p>On a stage this would require a costume quick-change into and out of a pretty significant costume that often needs the assistance of dressers to assist the actor.  With us all in quarantine, there was no dresser near the actor who played Ariel in order to allow for such an elaborate costume change.  The director (Pat Nims, the creator of <a href="https://zoomtheatre.com">Zoom Theatre</a>) suggested that we could use <a href="https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/">Snap Camera</a> (a desktop application by Snapchat that lets you use snapchat filters with your webcam) to essentially create a virtual costume for Ariel as a harpy.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I couldn't find a snapchat filter that would accomplish this task among the thousands of snapchat filters available.  When something doesn't exist... make it yourself.  Snapchat also has an application called <a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/">Lens Studio</a> that allows you to create your own snapchat filters which can then be published.</p>

<p>It was difficult, as it involved mapping 2 dimensional images into a 3 dimensional AR mesh of the human face and shoulders, but the end result was fantastic.  In order to make the filter usable, I had to actually publish it to snapchat's library of filters, which means if you would like, you can become a harpy either in snapchat on your phone or in lens studio yourself using the filter I made for this production.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&uuid=b221e35242564672a10561598efd1a1e&metadata=01"><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/harpy-snapcode.svg" alt="Become a Harpy" width="320" height="320" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/harpy-snapcode.png" alt="Become a Harpy" width="320" height="320" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></a></p>

<p>Snap the snapcode above on your phone to use it on your phone, or copy <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&amp;uuid=b221e35242564672a10561598efd1a1e&amp;metadata=01">this url</a> and paste it into the search box in Snap Camera to use it on your computer webcam.</p>

<h2>Flying Between Windows</h2>

<p>Zoom Theatre makes use of zoom's gallery view and the feature of multi-spotlighting to arrange which user appears on which part of the screen.  We then use zoom's background image feature to slice up a background image so that the various windows connect together to appear as one large image, helping to sell the idea that these actors are all together in the same space.</p>

<p>There is a scene where 3 roman goddesses appear to bless the impending nuptuals of the romantic leads of the show.  The director wanted 2 of these goddesses to appear "in the sky" and then "descend" down to earth during the scene.  What he wanted is for these godddesses to appear in one part of the screen, and then move to another part of the screen (basically move between zoom windows)</p>

<p>To accomplish this, we doubled up the computers at the 2 actors location.  They had 2 different computers connected to the same zoom call allowing us to pin the actor to essentially be in 2 places at once.  We then used <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a> to create a virtual webcam on both computers that would allow us to control the positioning of the camera in both spaces and animate the movement between them.  On one of the computers I had the actor appear at the top of the scene (camera on dead center), on the other the actor doesn't appear (nothing but a green background which could then be chroma keyed out).</p>

<p>I then created a transition animation between 2 "scenes" (OBS Terminology) where on the top the camera image would be animated to descend out of the frame, and on the other the camera would descend into the frame.  With techs on both computers ready to hit the animation simultaneously, we were able to create an effective transition where the goddess Iris would descend from the sky on the top left of the overall image, and into the ground view on the bottom left.  A short while later, the goddess Juno would descend from the top right to the bottom right.  When timed correctly this effect worked very well.</p>

<p>Without the use of OBS, we did a similar effect earlier in the show where we had 2 cameras on 2 computers aimed low and high, so an actor laying down could stand up causing their torso to appear on the top row of windows and their legs to appear on the bottom row.</p>

<p>The effects were impressive and really helped build a virtual "stage" that the audience could suspend disbelief to feel like actors were really sharing the stage together.</p>

<h2>The Goddesses Show Their Powers</h2>

<p>Those same goddesses I mentioned earlier (along with a third goddess, Ceres) also needed another effect (a unique one for each of them) to help make them stand out in their big dance number.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/goddesses.webp" alt="The Goddesses" width="3140" height="1804" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/goddesses.png" alt="Become a Harpy" width="3140" height="1804" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>Each of these effects is unique and I accomplished them in different ways</p>

<h3>Iris, Goddess of the Rainbow</h3>

<p>In both Greek and Roman mythology, Iris is the goddess of the rainbow.  For Iris I thought it might be interesting to create chromatic tinted ghost images that follow her movement.  To do this I used OBS again.  I duplicated the camera into 5 copies, with different filters on each virtual copy.</p>

<p>I then layered these cameras (Each with chroma keying out) on top of each other to create the effect.  From top to bottom:</p>

<ol>
<li>The top layer is just the camera itself, in full color, with the background chroma-keyed out.</li>
<li>The next layer down is the same, except for 2 extra filters.  First I tinted the image red using color correction, and then made the image slightly transparent.  I then also put a small delay (100 miliseconds) so that when the top layer moves, the next layer would move a tenth of a second later.</li>
<li>The next layer down is the same as above, except the delay is increased to 200 miliseconds and the color correction tints the image yellow instead of red.</li>
<li>The next layer down is the same as above, except the delay is increased to 300 miliseconds and the color correction tints the image blue instead of red or yellow.</li>
<li>Finally the original camera image (without any corrections or even chroma keying) is placed on the background.  This allows the transparent colored layers to appear over the top of the background without issues.</li>
</ol>

<p>The ending effect makes it when Iris moves, there is a rainbow following her movement behind her.  I'm personally very happy with this effect as it is really unique.  It is possible to accomplish the same effect using snap filters, but it would require quite a bit of work and I was unable to get it to look as good in snap camera as I could in OBS in time for the show to open.</p>

<h3>Juno, Queen of the Gods</h3>

<p>Juno was difficult, she's the queen of the Roman pantheon, but isn't really associated with something that is an easy imagery like the rainbow for Iris.  I decided to simply give her an aura, specifically a purple aura, causing her to "glow" with purple regal light, kind of like the auras Disney used to represent most of the Greek pantheon in the animated <em>Hercules</em> movie.</p>

<p>This purple aura I accomplished by creating yet another snap filter in Lens Studio where I used masking layers to create a glow, which I simply tinted purple.  This is a relatively simple filter, but I found it surprisingly difficult to get right where the aura would follow the actress without bleeding too much.  I spent a lot of time tweaking and improving the filter until I had the effect right.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of testing the filter on myself while I was working on it:</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/nick-glowing.webp" alt="Nick is Glowing" width="1418" height="786" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/nick-glowing.png" alt="Nick is Glowing" width="1418" height="785" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>Since I had to publish this filter as well, if you are interested in turning yourself purple <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&amp;uuid=0628b20fcfed427a8a0f5fed6b87819c&amp;metadata=01">you can</a>!</p>

<h3>Ceres, Goddess of Agriculture</h3>

<p>Ceres is the Roman aspect of the Greek Goddess Demeter, the goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility and motherly relationships.</p>

<p>I had a hard time coming up with an effect for this one, but in the end I happened across a snap filter that someone else created.  Someone who goes by Virtuose Reality created a <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&amp;uuid=34225a140f534044918282fa5a9445bb&amp;metadata=01">snap filter</a> where after a few moments a crown made of vines grows around the head of the wearer, then flowers bloom, and finally a hummingbird starts flying around drinking from the flowers.  This a seriously impressive filter, that I can't take ANY credit for.  <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&amp;uuid=34225a140f534044918282fa5a9445bb&amp;metadata=01">Try it out</a>, it's really cool, and worked fantastically for the Goddess of Agriculture.</p>

<h2>Other Visual Effects</h2>

<p>There are other effects in the show, including some devil dogs which was created with <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&amp;uuid=2eda6d9adcc3428a8bd5e9d0d75038f9&amp;metadata=01">another filter I found</a> that puts a dog head shaped helmet on top of your head.</p>

<p>We considered using a red eye effect on Caliban, but in the end we decided not to bother with it as it would make camera changes more difficult.</p>

<p>Some other effects were accomplished by using video files that Pat created as the backgrounds, which I can't take any credit for.</p>

<h2>Sound Design</h2>

<p>This show also had a ton of sound effects to work with, many of which required layering different sounds on top of each other.</p>

<p>One thing I did in this show that I don't often have to do is create background audio "loops."  For those that don't know creating an audio loop is a technique of making sure the end of the audio file matches up perfectly with the beginning of the audio file so that the sound could loop continuously without anybody noticing it.</p>

<p>Pat wanted to make sure that the magic storm that shipwrecked people on Prospero's island was always "present" which I accomplished by creating a number of long audio loops that could play in the background quietly without people noticing how much they were repeating.  A few well placed thunderclaps over the top of that audio loop helped also distract people from noticing the 10 minute audio loops as being loops.</p>

<h2>Zoom on Remote Control</h2>

<p>Finally one more thing that Zoom Theatre did with this show that they had not previously done, is use a new custom zoom client by <a href="https://www.liminalet.com/">Liminal Entertainment Technologies</a> called <a href="https://www.liminalet.com/zoomosc">ZoomOSC</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control">Open Sound Control (OSC)</a> is a text based network protocol designed back in 2002 to allow for remote control of synthesizers and other equipment during a show.</p>

<p>ZoomOSC is a custom created zoom client that listens for these commands from a show controller, and both relays the commands through Zoom's chat feature to copies of ZoomOSC running on other computers as well as doing a number of things in response to these commands.</p>

<p>It took some trickery to get to work properly, but in the end this allowed <a href="https://qlab.app/">QLab</a>, the software I've long used for cueing up sound and video effects in theatre, to control not only my own zoom client, but the zoom clients of the actors.  I could use it to spotlight different participants at different times so that whenever a scene is supposed to change, I could bring up the appropriate actors for each scene.</p>

<p>The software is quite powerful, it could be used to command each person's zoom client to change cameras and backgrounds automatically as well as controlling muting and unmuting of audio throughout the show.</p>

<p>As it was the first time Zoom Theatre used this software for a show, we started simple, with just using the software to control spotlighting, relying on Zoom Theatre's tried and true methods of having crew members remoting into actor computers to handle everything else.</p>

<h2>What a Show</h2>

<p>If you managed to see <em>The Tempest</em>, you know it was an impressive undertaking that you don't normally see in live theatre productions done over zoom, and hopefully you now have an appreciation of the work that was put into the show.</p>

<p>The above is just the things that I was involved with, but we also had a music director create original musical compositions for the show, a costumer costuming people without ever seeing them to take measurements, shipping clothes to the actors.</p>

<p>We had a props master sending props to the actors, in some cases sending duplicates of the same props to multiple actors so that they could "hand off" a prop between zoom windows.</p>

<p>And we had someone create original hand-painted backgrounds for every location in the show.  All of this work by many people came together to create a unique show experience that was a true joy to be a part of.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>I love Live Theatre, I love attending as an audience member, I love acting (though I haven't gotten to do that in a decade and a half), and I love working behind the scenes (mostly in Sound Design, but I've done a number of different jobs).</p>

<p>Over the last few years I've made an effort to try something new with most shows I do.  I either learn a new skill or try a new experiment.  With my latest show open, I thought I'd go over some of the new things I've learned or tried in the last few years of shows, as well as a peek at what i've done for <a href="http://www.zoomtheater.com/index.php/shows/the-tempest"><em>The Tempest</em></a>.</p>

<h2>My Theatrical past</h2>

<h3>The College Years 2005-2006</h3>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/mcm1940.webp" alt="Musical Comedy Murders of 1940" width="768" height="1024" layout="responsive" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>I never finished college, but while I was there at <a href="https://www.tccd.edu">Tarrant County College</a> in Arlington, TX I did get to participate in 3 productions.  In February of 2005, I <a href="2005-01-24-drama-king">acted in a production</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Musical_Comedy_Murders_of_1940"><em>The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940</em></a> as the character of Roger Hopewell.  I had long loved theatre before this, but after acting in that show, I was hooked.</p>

<p>Later that spring I served as Light Board Operator for the school's production of William Shakespeare's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Dream"><em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em></a>, which I found every bit as enjoyable as acting.  This was in a way the beginning of my learning new tasks with shows as I did not have much prior experience with theatrical lighting (other than the simple light system at my church at the time).</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/rumors.webp" alt="Rumors" width="1024" height="768" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/rumors.jpg" alt="Rumors" width="1024" height="768" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>The following winter I acted in another production, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumors_(play)"><em>Rumors</em></a> by Neil Simon in the role of Ken Gorman.</p>

<h3>The lost decade 2007-2017</h3>

<p>When I moved to California to work for Justia, I focused my energy on working for a while and did not get any opportunities to act in or crew any shows.  I did however get multiple opportunities to see theatrical productions, however.  I enjoyed seeing professional productions of <em>Wicked</em>, <em>Promises, Promises</em>, <em>Spamalot</em>, <a href="2012-10-13-newsies-on-broadway"><em>Newsies</em></a>, <em>How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</em>, and more.</p>

<p>I also saw a number of community theatre productions including: <em>A Funny Thing Happens on the Way to the Forum</em>, <em>Into the Woods</em>, and <em>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</em> (at my future community theatre home of Sunnyvale Community Players).</p>

<h3>Returning to Theatre, 2017</h3>

<p>In 2017, after working with Justia for 10 full years, I decided the time was right to return to the theatre in some capacity.  I didn't think I had the free time available to act again, but when I saw an email from SCP (I ended up on their mailing list after I attended <em>Drood</em>) that they were looking for sound people.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/drowsy.webp" alt="The Drowsy Chaperone" width="3000" height="1686" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/drowsy.jpg" alt="The Drowsy Chaperone" width="3000" height="1686" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>Having had some experience with sound from my time at <em>Eden Road</em>, I reached out and came on as a sound board operator for SCP's production of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613202413/http://www.sunnyvaleplayers.org/the-drowsy-chaperone.html"><em>The Drowsy Chaperone</em></a>.  With this production just learning how live sound works in the 2010s was a learning curve for me.  The last sound-board I had used before then was an analog board, so just learning digital sound with the <a href="https://www.midasconsoles.com/product.html?modelCode=P0B3I">Midas M32</a> was a learning curve.</p>

<p>Over the 2017 summer I got a chance to run sound for <a href="2017-07-10-next-normal-next-perfect"><em>Next to Normal</em></a> up in San Francisco.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/fiddler.webp" alt="SCP Fiddler on the Roof" width="4048" height="3036" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/fiddler.jpg" alt="SCP Fiddler on the Roof" width="4048" height="3036" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>In the fall of 2017 I had one of the most pivotal events of my life when I worked on my second SCP production, <em>Fiddler on the Roof</em>.  This show was so incredible that I am embarrassed for myself that I haven't really written a full post about it before.  I will have to write up a full retrospective of that show in the future, but it changed my life in many ways.  The show was also big thanks to the incredible contribution of Eric Sun as our Fiddler.  The show was actually written up in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/01/a-tech-pioneers-final-unexpected-act">The New Yorker</a>.</p>

<h4>Introduction of Video, <em>Avenue Q</em></h4>

<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923135233/http://www.sunnyvaleplayers.org/avenue-q.html"><em>Avenue Q</em></a>, I got my first experience with dealing with video effects in a show.  I was just an operator on the show, so I didn't learn too much, but I did get to experiment with video from QLab for the first time in this show.</p>

<h2>Learning Sound Design, 2018</h2>

<h4><em>Addams Family</em></h4>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/addams.webp" alt="Addams Family" width="2833" height="1500" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/addams.jpg" alt="Addams Family" width="2833" height="1500" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>With Addams Family in early 2018 I got my first opportunity to design sound.  I co-designed sound with the great Dan Singletary and learned how to create my own sound effects, and learned a lot about balancing a band and equalization techniques.</p>

<p>Due to overlapping shows, I went back to an operator for <em>La Cage aux Folles</em> but I learned a lot in that show as well.</p>

<h2>2018-2019</h2>

<h3>Producing, Pins, and Jukebox</h3>

<h4><em>High School Musical, JR</em> and <em>Grease</em></h4>

<p>In hindsight, my first experiences with producing probably should not have been 2 shows at the same time, but due to overlapping production schedules I was learning on my feet with producing 2 shows at the same time.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/pins.webp" alt="SCP50 Pins" width="4032" height="3024" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/pins.jpg" alt="SCP50 Pins" width="4032" height="3024" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p><em>Grease</em> marked the first show in SCP's 50th season, so to celebrate, I got my first experience with physical product design as I designed a run of collectable pins for the season.  The pins were popular and it gave me an opportunity to do some actual design.  With the help of my artistic brother, I designed a unique pin for each show in the 50th season, as well as a season pin that brought aspects of the 4 pins together into a single pin.</p>

<p><em>Grease</em> also marked the beginning of my concept of wanting to "plus" my designs.  I learned how to have QLab actually control the sound board, and I used this skill to have the show's pre-show music not come from a predefined playlist like usual.  Instead I used 2 tablets to create a jukebox, one in the lobby in a jukebox facadé, and one in the sound booth plugged into an input on the sound board.  With this I had a number of 50s era songs put up for selection in the jukebox and the audience got to choose the songs that would play both before the show and in intermission.</p>

<p>As it was set in the same general time-frame, I re-used this jukebox in <em>Bye, Bye, Birdie</em> in the spring.</p>

<h3>Sound Design Programmed Tricks</h3>

<p>Starting with <em>Bye, Bye, Birdie</em> I started experimenting with programming more unique audio effects into the shows I did sound design for.  <em>Birdie</em> has both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diegetic_music">diegetic</a> and non-diegetic, in that some of the songs in the show are "performances" by Conrad Birdie and are thus "really" happening within the context of the show.  I decided a nice way to differentiate this is by having a different reverb on Birdie's voice when the song was diegetic then when he was singing a song that was non-diegetic.  It was a simple effect, but it added a little something extra to a show.</p>

<h3>Going overkill, <em>Jekyll and Hyde</em></h3>

<p>For <em>Jekyll &amp; Hyde</em> I returned to the producer role, but I also sound designed again.  As a producer on this show, I spent some time learning photoshop and InDesign and created all of the marketing materials of the show myself.  I was very proud of my poster designs which was also used in the show's program.</p>

<p>In my sound design of the show I continued with my trend of special audio effects by having a different equalization on Hyde's voice than Jekyll's.  This helped push the narrative that these characters were distinct as the quality of their voices were different.  I also played some with audio panning of vocals in this show.  In the pivotal "Confrontation" song I had Jekyll &amp; Hyde's voices coming from different sides of the stage, which was difficult considering both parts are sung by the same person.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/D85_4702.webp" alt="The Magic Mirror" width="3500" height="2333" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/D85_4702.jpg" alt="The Magic Mirror" width="3500" height="2333" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>If producing and sound design weren't enough, I also took on the task of doing a special visual effect for the show.  The director wanted a "magic mirror" effect in the show, so I learned video editing and how to use QLab to dynamically switch between a live camera feed and a pre-recorded video.  The effect was impressive, for most of the show this "mirror" actually "reflected" the environment around by showing a live camera feed, but at pivotal moments, Hyde or Jekyll would appear in the mirror to contrast the opposing character that was currently in control of Doctor Jekyll's body.</p>

<h3>The Magic Hourglass, <em>Freaky Friday</em></h3>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/D85_6238.webp" alt="Freaky Friday Hourglass" width="2400" height="2400" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/D85_6238.jpg" alt="Freaky Friday Hourglass" width="2400" height="2400" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>In <em>Freaky Friday</em>, the magical McGuffin that sets the story in motion is a magical hourglass.  The hourglass breaks immediately after its magic causes the body-swap to take place, and they spend the rest of the show trying to find another magic hourglass to switch them back.</p>

<p>I decided to take on a task of making this magic hourglass for the show.  In this I learned a bit of building physical props, including recycling items (coke bottles), a bit of wood-working, creating secret ways to break the device apart.  Most importantly I used this to get into Internet-of-Things devices by creating small wifi controlled light pods which could be put into compartments in the top and bottom of the hourglass.  With some python and third party tools I made it where the lights in the hourglass could be controlled by the theatre light-board so the lighting designer could include the glowing in his lighting design.</p>

<h2>The Pandemic</h2>

<p>Unfortunately 1 week after the show closed, the pandemic hit and we could no longer produce live theatre in front of audiences.  I spent the better part of the year not being involved in any theatre at all, but then one of my friends who I worked with at SCP contacted me about a show he was doing with <a href="https://www.zoomtheatre.com">Zoom Theatre</a> over Zoom.</p>

<p>While I had seen a number of zoom shot shows over the year of the pandemic, this was unique in that they invited the audience to actually join the zoom meeting and enable their microphones so that the actors can get real-time feedback.</p>

<h3>Theatre over Zoom, <em>I and You</em></h3>

<p>My learning in <em>I and You</em> was mostly about learning how theatre works over zoom.  Zoom Theatre is great in that rather than just having actors read over a zoom like a dramatic reading, they actually work to both exemplify the strengths of zoom (like the ability to switch cameras and switch backgrounds easily), and minimize the weaknesses to really make it feel like actors are together in the same room.</p>

<p>I love how they actively slice up background images so that the different zoom windows of the individual actors line up.  They then work with duplicate props and careful choreography to do things like prop hand-offs, helping to sell the idea that people are actually together in the same room.</p>

<p>Live Theatre has always required suspension of disbelief, which takes on another meaning when acting over Zoom.  Since actors aren't physically in the same space, you need to do everything you can to allow the audience to suspend their disbelief and actually believe that people are in the same space.</p>

<h3>Real-Time Visual Effects, <em>The Tempest</em></h3>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/tempest-1260x717.webp" alt="The Tempest" width="1260" height="717" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2021/03/tempest-1260x717.png" alt="The Tempest" width="1260" height="717" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>Finally after a very long post, I get to the show I'm currently working on.  <em>The Tempest</em> is also being put on by Zoom Theatre and it is phenomenal.  For this show however I was tasked with creating some real-time visual effects using a combination of <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a> and, believe-it-or-not, Snapchat's <a href="https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/">Snap Camera</a>.</p>

<p>Using the filter creation tool <a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/">Lens Studio</a> (also by Snap), I created a number of unique snap filters which at key points in the show can be switched on.</p>

<p>When the show is over I'll put up another post outlining exactly how I created the snap filters as well as the effects in OBS Studio that actually allow characters to break out of their zoom window in real time.</p>

<p>If you want to see these effects in action, <a href="https://zoomtheatre.com/index.php/shows/the-tempest">come see <em>The Tempest</em></a>, it is as close as you can get to live theatre while having everyone involved practicing social distancing.</p>

<p>The best part, you can see this phenomenal show, and my visual effects for FREE!.  The tickets cost you nothing, we have 4 performances remaining (as of the time of publication).</p>

    <summary type="html">As some people in my city are being evacuated due to encroaching fires, I finally setup my weather station to track the weather and air quality....</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p><strong>I don't normally put a <code>TL;DR</code> in my blog posts, but I do feel the need to preface the beginning of this post by saying, while Irvine, CA is currently under Evacuation Orders, the Evacuation Order does not include my part of Irvine, we are currently safe, though the air quality is a bit poor.  I'll be sure to update social media if we end up being evacuated.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>I've long been fascinated by personal weather stations, and long wanted one of my own so I can track weather conditions at my exact location.  The last couple of years I've been particularly interested in tracking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index">Air Quality Index (AQI)</a> along with other weather data. The reason for this was the annual wildfires that impact the air quality in the SF bay area (and other areas of the west coast).</p>

<p>A couple of months ago, on a day the AQI in Sunnyvale was particularly bad (everything outside was tinted orange), I went ahead and purchased the <a href="https://ambientweather.com/amws2902.html">WS-2902C</a> along with the optional addon units for measuring the PM2.5 Air Quality (one of the main factors that the AQI is calculated from) both inside and outside my apartment.  I went with the Ambient Weather unit for a number of reasons.  Of course having those Air Quality sensors were a big part of it, but I also was interested in being able to track weather online.  The Ambient Weather unit had the extra interesting improvements of integration with both IFTTT and Google Assistant, which fits into my smarthome setup quite well.</p>

<p>By the time my unit arrived however the air quality was marginally better, and more importantly it was looking more and more likely that I was going to end up moving out of the bay area (<a href="2020-10-04-the-next-adventure">I did</a>) so I didn't set it up.</p>

<p>I haven't been in Irvine an entire month yet (heck I haven't even reached 2 weeks yet) and now there are evacuations in this very city because of wildfires down here.  At the moment my new home (shown below as the blue dot) is not yet under evacuation orders (or an evacuation warning), but the smoke is in the air and the air quality is once again bad.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2020/10/weather/fire-evacuations.webp" alt="Map of Fire Evacuations in Irvine" width="1355" height="1252" layout="responsive" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>Since the air quality was bad again, the time was right to finally crack open the box and setup our new weather station.  While it looked complicated, assembly was fairly simple and I now have a fully functional internet connected weather station on my patio.</p>

<h2>The Unit and my Setup</h2>

<p>On the patio I have the Osprey Sensor array which includes a weather vane, speed cups, an Ambient/UV Light sensor, a Thermo-Hygrometer, and a rain gauge.  The unit is primarily powered by a solar panel on the top of the unit, with 2 AA batteries to provide backup power if not enough solar energy is collected in a given day.  The unit transmits via RF (at 915 MHz) to a console located inside the apartment.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2020/10/weather/PXL_20201027_064916207.NIGHT.webp" alt="The Weather Unit on my patio, yes there is construction outside, great view" width="4032" height="3024" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2020/10/weather/PXL_20201027_064916207.NIGHT.jpg" alt="The Weather Unit on my patio, yes there is construction outside, great view" width="4032" height="3024" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>Also on the patio is a separate solar powered unit which is the Outdoor version of the PM2.5 Particulate Monitor, which also communicates with the console inside via 915 MHz RF.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2020/10/weather/PXL_20201027_064931760.NIGHT.webp" alt="Air Quality Sensor PM 2.5" width="4032" height="3024" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2020/10/weather/PXL_20201027_064931760.NIGHT.jpg" alt="Air Quality Sensor PM 2.5" width="4032" height="3024" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>Inside the apartment is the centralized console.  The console contains an LED display unit.  Note when I say it is an LED, it is not a video screen.  The individual LEDs light up like a traditional LCD calculator (but lit) and each LED can only light a particular area of the display.  On the display are readouts for Wind Speed and Direction, Rainfall, Outdoor Temperature and Humidity, Time and Date, Moon Phase, Barometric Pressure, a Weather Forecaast, Solar Radiation, and the UV Index.  There is also a display for the Indoor temperature and Humidity which comes from another Thermo-Hygrometer sensor located in the console itself.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2020/10/weather/PXL_20201027_065019498.webp" alt="The Main Console Display" width="4032" height="3024" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2020/10/weather/PXL_20201027_065019498.jpg" alt="The Main Console Display" width="4032" height="3024" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>In addition to the 915 MHz RF receiver that receives communications from the other devices, this also contains a 2.4 GHz WiFi radio inside which is used to connect to your home WiFi connection for transmitting the data to the internet.  You'll note I did not mention anything on the display that mentioned displaying the PM2.5 Particulate Monitor data, this data is only available on the internet dashboards and mobile app.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2020/10/weather/Screenshot_20201027-001612.webp" alt="Viewing Air Quality on the Mobile App" width="1080" height="2160" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2020/10/weather/Screenshot_20201027-001612.png" alt="Viewing Air Quality on the Mobile App" width="1080" height="2160" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>The unit can also receive from a second PM2.5 Particulate Monitor unit, which instead of being powered by solar is powered by a USB charger.  This is for monitoring the air quality inside the apartment, we placed this unit in our bedroom to get an indication of what the air quality is where Barbara will be spending most of her time.  The console can also receive from (and upload) data from up to 8 additional Thermo-Hygrometers.  We placed one of these in our bedroom to sense the temperature and humidity in our room, as well as another one in Joey's (Barbara's Brother) room.</p>

<p>We need to purchase a 3rd to put into Dorothy's (Barbara's Mom) room to finish out the sensing in the apartment, but as I mentioned we purchased this in our old home where we only had 2 bedrooms so we only purchased 2 of them.  We'll pick up an additional 1 (or possibly a few) to monitor other rooms. It would be interesting to monitor temperature and humidity in the bathrooms as I'm sure the humidity spikes whenever someone takes a shower.</p>

<p>With everything setup, I can now access my data in a variety of places.  The unit's native home is <a href="https://ambientweather.net/dashboard/435a5c93160dc349b6a8f4b1cc27f054">Ambient Weather's own weather data service</a> which works very well, but you can also set the unit up to upload directly to <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/dashboard/pws/KCAIRVIN182">Weather Underground</a> or <a href="https://app.weathercloud.net/d2434962961#profile">Weathercloud</a>.  You aren't limited to one of these services either, those links are links to the public versions of the weather data from my weather station on all 3 services.</p>

</amp-img></p>

<p>From Ambient Weather you can also integrate with a number of other 3rd party services.  The first is PWS Weather which doesn't have as nice of an interface as any of the direct services, but what is nice is the ability to easily download a CSV log of the data, there's no public view of this one that I can find so no link here.  If you don't want to have your unit upload to Weather Underground directly, you can also just upload to Ambient Weather and have them integrate with Weather Underground from their service.</p>

<p>The more exciting integrations from Ambient Weather's service is that it can integrate with Alexa, Google Assistant, and IFTTT.  I will surely be setting up some interesting integrations from IFTTT to automate things based on my weather data (for example flashing my smart lights red if the air quality gets particularly bad).  I could eventually do some automation with other pieces of equipment, for example I can turn on a humidifier if the humidity drops too low (or a dehumidifier if it gets too high), or an air filter whenever the air quality reaches certain thresholds.</p>

<p>As for Google Assistant, at this point the integration is a little limited, but it is nice to be able to ask a Google Home for one or more of the pieces of live weather data from my weather station.  I hope this integration will become more robust over time as I'd love to be able to replace standard internet data with my localized data, or integrate this data in routines.</p>

    <summary type="html">After 14 years in Silicon Valley, I&#039;m packing up and moving to southern California, to take on new challenges....</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>Over the past few years, I've gotten into playing a lot of <abbr title="Dungeons & Dragons">D&amp;D</abbr>. When a new campaign begins, it is fun to play a new character, to roll the stats of that character and start building his backstory, creating the new aspects of the character that make him unique, and then venturing out with a new group of friends to create a new story together.</p>

<p>In real life we don't start over so completely. And yet when you do make a major change, it can often feel like rolling up a new character to take on the next great adventure.</p>

<p>Almost exactly 14 years ago, my wife and I packed up a minivan and left Texas behind to move to Silicon Valley, California to start a new adventure. Here we were, knowing almost no one and starting life in a new home working at a new company.</p>

<p>Nearly a decade and a half later we have quite a life here, we have several different circles of friends, between coworkers and colleagues I've met through Justia, tech friends we met through tech conferences, and theater friends we met through Sunnyvale Community Players. I've traveled around the country going to legal tech conferences with Justia, and on the way I've gotten to see shows on Broadway and sporting events around the country.</p>

<p>I've gotten to dust off my sound operator skills running sound for a variety of theater productions, and I've grown those skills into sound design having designed sound for roughly half a dozen shows. More recently I've branched into special effects by creating a raspberry pi based solution for doing portable lighting effects on the stage.</p>

<p>Life has been an adventure, and my little adventuring party has grown along the way. There are many I'd consider close friends here, and I'm glad to be with all of them.</p>

<p>In D&amp;D one of the most exciting parts of a campaign is when your party establishes a headquarters, a home base that they customize just for their party and offers respite from the rigors of adventuring life. Early on, adventurers are nomadic and spend little or no time at "home," but later in the campaign, they need that home base in order to prepare for the challenges that lie ahead.</p>

<p>In 2020, we all have faced challenges beyond anything that has happened in our lifetimes. The global pandemic has decimated the economy and killed hundreds of thousands of people. For those of us that haven't gotten sick, we've had to adapt to a new way of life where we have to keep our distance from each other and do everything we can to protect ourselves and others (<em>I shouldn't have to say this, but come on everyone, just wear a mask</em>).</p>

<p>A big part of that has been staying home a lot more. We've all been forced to retreat to our homes, to our home bases, our headquarters, to stave off the invading hoard of the virus.</p>

<p>For many people I know, this has been annoying, but overall livable, but for others, such as Barbara and I, having to spend all our time at our home base in close quarters has simply driven home just how inadequate of a base our home is.</p>

<p>After 14 years working at Justia, I'm paid very well compared to the average American, but as someone living in the heart of Silicon Valley I've had to pay a princely sum every month in order to pay for my pauper dwelling. In D&amp;D "lifestyle" terms, my Level 14 Code Wizard has his spending setting set to "Aristocratic (10GP)," but lives in accommodations that would be classified as "Modest (1GP)" at best, or perhaps even "Poor (2SP)."</p>

<p>To be more specific, for the past year I've paid over $4,000 a month for a tiny 2 bedroom apartment.  And with 4 adults currently living in that 2 bedroom apartment, and those 4 adults spending every waking moment there except for occasional trips to a grocery store, this is not the type of home base I should have at this point in my life.</p>

<p>It is nothing against Justia or even against Silicon Valley, people choose to live here for a reason, and for a while it was exciting living the Silicon Valley life.</p>

<p>This pandemic has made me realize, however, that this is not the type of lifestyle I want to live long term. This is not the type of character I want to play indefinitely. I'd like to be able to live in a house, with a kitchen large enough to make gourmet meals, and perhaps a nice grill in the back yard. I'd love to have a garage I can setup a workshop in, to take on new, more creative projects.</p>

<p>Most importantly of all I'd like to have a separate workspace from my life space. I'd like to have an office where I can work separate from where I go to relax, where I can close myself off to be able to focus on work when I'm working, and close myself away from it when I'm playing.</p>

<p>Frankly, I'd also love it if I had a place where I could play D&amp;D with friends around a table, the way the game was designed to be played (perhaps on a custom gaming table built in that workshop).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't see my current adventure leading to that life, as Silicon Valley will always be so expensive to live that I won't be able to afford to establish that headquarters for my adventuring party.</p>

<p>And so, the time has come to roll a new character, to take on a new adventuring party and start off on a new adventure with that life as the endgame. I'm happy to announce that I've now taken a new position as Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.Ezoic.com">Ezoic, Inc</a> in Carlsbad, CA, and Barbara and I (along with her mother and brother who live with us), will be moving to southern California before the end of this month.</p>

<p>My last day with Justia will be October 15th, and my first official (but remote) day with Ezoic will be October 19th, 2020.</p>

<p>We've found a place to live, a temporary headquarters to start our journey down there in. For roughly $500/month less than I've been paying for this 2 bedroom apartment here, we've found a 3 bedroom apartment down there with more than twice the square footage, giving us all a lot more breathing room.</p>

<p>It isn't the house with a yard and a garage I can use as a workshop yet, but in order to save money on breaking my lease early, I had to choose an apartment owned by the same organization that owns my current apartment complex.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/2020/10/new-kitchen.webp" alt="Check out that Kitchen!" width="6342" height="2406" layout="responsive" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>While it doesn't give me my dream home right away, it is a lot more space and should be a lot more comfortable. The <a href="https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=LBF9qr6AHpw&amp;sr=-2.55,.79&amp;ss=3">kitchen is also glorious</a> being much larger than my current kitchen and containing advantages over my current kitchen, including a gas stove. My plan is to move again later, to a house that matches my desired criteria.</p>

<p>It is bittersweet to set off of this new adventure. I will miss my friends here in the bay area, and I'll miss Justia. I've loved working at Justia and have been very proud of the free legal information projects I've been a part of there.</p>

<p>At the same time, however, I'm very excited about what comes next. It is exciting to start a new campaign, to find new challenges.  I'm excited to see what projects I'll get to work on at Ezoic, and I'm very excited to start anew in a new area (well mostly new, I spent the first 10 years of my life in Southern California, and Barbara and I have visited Disneyland in Southern California, between 1 and 4 times a year for the last decade).</p>

<p><em>Your party sets out southward towards a new city, and a new home, with new foes to defeat, new challenges to undertake, and a new adventure around every corner.  Your party stumbles across something exciting along the way, Roll for Initiative.</em></p>

    <summary type="html">After several years of being separate, I&#039;ve merged my personal sites of NickMoline.com and Nick.pro into a single site, and given it a pretty substantial overhaul at the same time....</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>For several years, I've had 2 separate personal sites, <a href="https://www.nickmoline.com">NickMoline.com</a>, which for many years was a single page portfolio page which contained nothing but a short bio of me, links to various social media profiles of mine, and a link to <a href="https://www.nick.pro">nick.pro</a> which was my blog.  The portfolio page was a simple responsive HTML page, while the blog was running on WordPress and contained my musings on a variety of topics.</p>

<p>Over time though, both of these sites languished.  I posted to nick.pro only about once per year (<em>I missed 2018 entirely, with only a single post in 2019</em>), and nickmoline.com I ignored so long I didn't even realize it had been down for a long time until @emil10001 pointed out that my portfolio page was completely down.  Upon investigation, I noticed that it had actually been down for at least a year, and the last commit to the repo was <a href="https://github.com/nickmoline/nickmoline.github.io/commit/c0234b8c9205ada794d70e1a043a40cb16644533">on September 1, 2016</a> and consisted of only the <a href="https://keybase.io/nickmoline">Keybase</a> verification file for the domain.  The last substantial content commits to the page was <a href="https://github.com/nickmoline/nickmoline.github.io/commit/ef5ad46df31bece8aad76f6bbae4e890cdb86d64">in January, 2014</a>.</p>

<h2>Migration</h2>

<p>I decided the time had come to give the sites a drastic overhaul, and I decided that there really isn't much reason for 2 separate sites anymore.  I decided to centralize the sites on the domain that matches my full name domain <a href="https://www.nickmoline.com/">NickMoline.com</a>.  I also decided that as much as I love WordPress, I don't really need WordPress for my personal site.  As a coder, I'm actually more comfortable working in an IDE than a CMS.  As such I made the decision to <a href="2020-08-20-migrating-to-jekyll">migrate my blog from WordPress to Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>While an excellent <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/">wordpress plugin</a> to export posts into Jekyll compatible markdown files complete with front-matter exists, I wanted to take this opportunity to make my site 100% <a href="https://amp.dev/">AMP Only</a> which meant either scripting a change between tags blocked by AMP, or going through the posts one by one and cleaning up the markup to make sure it is compatible with AMP.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Accelerated Mobile Pages">AMP</abbr> Only</h3>

<p>For those readers who do not know, AMP is an HTML5 framework that <a href="https://amp.dev/about/how-amp-works/">puts limits</a> on which tags are allowed and how dynamic scripts are executed.  The reason for this is speed, by following these limits <a href="https://developers.google.com/amp">Google</a>, <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/Webmaster-Blog/September-2018/Introducing-Bing-AMP-viewer-and-Bing-AMP-cache">Bing</a>, and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/accelerated-mobile/">others</a> are able to cache the content of the pages in such a way that they can display the AMP content nearly instantly.</p>

<p>I wrote articles on Justia's Legal Marketing &amp; Technology Blog in <a href="https://onward.justia.com/2017/02/02/amp-your-law-firm-mobile-site/">2017</a> and <a href="https://onward.justia.com/2018/02/09/amp-update-get-even-amped-2018/">2018</a> in addition to a number of blog posts based on <a href="https://onward.justia.com/tag/amp-project/">events</a> related to AMP.</p>

<p>I've long been a fan and champion of the AMP Project and feel it is an important step forward in cleaning up the web after decades of plugins, javascript libraries, extensive backend processing, and larger and larger static resources have resulted in a web that often doesn't meet the performance demands of those who are using it. Google is well aware of this, as I posted on Justia's blog in <a href="https://onward.justia.com/2017/07/05/page-speed-tips-and-tools/">July of 2017</a> and have long been doing everything they can to make the web perform faster.  AMP is part of this process.</p>

<p>While it is possible (and in fact normal) to make AMP Equivalent versions of existing non-AMP pages for the sake of having the performance of AMP while not sacrificing the interactivity of non-AMP pages, I have long believed it is just as possible to have all of that same interactivity without sacrificing AMP, and as such I made the decision to go AMP only with my site.</p>

<p>You can see evidence of this interactivity throughout this site, from things as simple as <a href="2019-05-30-google-io-2019-io19">embedded youtube videos</a>, to more complex things such as <a href="2008-08-19-hours-away-from-vacation">photo gallery sliders with lightbox popups</a> and <a href="2003-09-05-internet-fads">hovering videos that keep playing after you scroll away</a>, all without compromising AMP's various benefits.</p>

<p>For example on pages with lots of images or embeds such as my post about <a href="2019-05-30-google-io-2019-io19">Google I/O 2019</a>, the embeds are only loaded as you scroll down the page, allowing what would normally stall rendering to be deferred until you scroll.</p>

<p>In time I plan to add even more interactivity into this site by implementing <a href="https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/">Progressive Web Apps</a> using <a href="https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-install-serviceworker/">amp-install-serviceworker</a> to enable PWA functionality in my AMP page.  <code>amp-install-serviceworker</code> allows AMP developers to implement the more dynamic functions that typically require extensive javascript libraries without compromising AMP's requirements by installing it in the background after the content of the page has loaded.  Future loads of the site after that point will be even faster as the service worker will initiate right away and render the more dynamic content immediately upon page load.</p>

<h3>Image optimization and WebP</h3>

<p>Another improvement I went through when I setup this new version of my site was optimizing every single image on the site.  I passed all of the JPEG, PNG and GIF images on the site through optimizers such as <a href="http://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim</a>, and <a href="http://pngmini.com/">ImageAlpha</a> in order to make the images as small as possible without a noticeable decrease in image quality.  To make this process as efficient as possible I used the great <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/imageoptim-cli">imageoptim-cli</a> command line tool written in Node to enable me to automate the process.</p>

<p>In addition to optimizing the PNG, JPEG, and GIF images as much as possible, I also used the open source <a href="http://abic.sourceforge.net/">Advanced Batch Image Converter</a> application to create WebP versions of most of the images.  <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp">WebP</a> is a relatively new image format created by Google along with it's big brother <a href="https://www.webmproject.org/">WebM</a> which is a video format.  Both formats were designed to make images and videos (respectively) load much quicker without sacrificing quality.  WebP supports alpha transparency like PNGs and full photo quality like JPEG while producing images that are on average 25-35% smaller than JPEG.  WebP even sorts <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/faq#why_should_i_use_animated_webp">animations</a> like the older more limited GIF format, allowing for far more robust image formats.</p>

<p>Just about the only downside to WebP is that there are still a few holdouts as far as <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=webp">browser support</a> when it comes to the format.  Safari (including iOS Safari) does not currently support WebP, however Apple has just announced that WebP image support is coming in the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/22/webp-safari-14/">Safari 14</a> which will ship with iOS 14 and macOS 11 Big Sur.</p>

<p>While Microsoft's Internet Explorer does not support WebP (and won't), Internet Explorer has been discontinued and  Microsoft's own apps will stop supporting the browser starting with Microsoft Teams removing support on November 30th, 2020 and all Microsoft 365 apps <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-apps-say-farewell-to-internet-explorer-11-and/ba-p/1591666">removing support by August 17, 2021</a>.  The newer Edge browser which replaces Internet Explorer <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2018/10/04/edgehtml-18-october-2018-update/">added support for WebP in Edge version 18</a>.</p>

<p>Mozilla Firefox <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/01/firefox-65-webp-flexbox-inspector-new-tooling/#:~:text=Media%3A%20Support%20for%20WebP%20and,with%20the%20same%20image%20quality.">added support for WebP in version 65</a> released in January, 2019.</p>

<p>Once Apple's Safari 14 achieves widespread adoption, we can comfortably say that WebP support has near universal support.</p>

<p>In order to make sure that browsers that don't yet support WebP, I made sure to implement the <a href="https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/develop/style_and_layout/placeholders/">fallback</a> protocol in the amp-img spec to ensure that browsers that don't yet support WebP will be served the JPEG or PNG equivalent format instead.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;amp-img src="[webpurl]" width="x" height="y" layout="responsive" lightbox&gt;
   &lt;amp-img fallback src="[jpegurl]" width="x" height="y" layout="responsive" lightbox&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;
&lt;/amp-img&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This ensures that browsers that do support WebP will be served the lighter faster image format, while browsers that don't yet support it will still be able to work by being served a still optimized as much as possible JPEG or PNG version.</p>

<h3>Cleaning Up Content</h3>

<p>Since I went through every post by hand, I spent time cleaning up old pages that were originally marked up in XHTML or even <a href="2004-08-17-archive-tweaks">HTML4</a>.  Some particularly bad posts include a <a href="2006-05-30-personality-test">personality test</a> I took back in 2006 which had multiple embedded tables and had Gauges made by repeating pipe symbols (<code>|</code>) to varying widths.  Without modifying the content of these posts, I took the liberty of redoing their markup using HTML 5 techniques including the same <code>&lt;progress&gt;</code> tag that I was using for the tracking gauge I had put up for tracking migration of the site.</p>

<p>I also have corrected numerous spelling errors and other grammatical mistakes that I found highly embarrassing, again without altering the meaning or content of the posts.</p>

<p>There are numerous posts I found embarrassing, but rather than erase the past, I found it important to keep embarrassing content intact, only correcting spelling and grammar errors where necessary.</p>

<h3>Tracking Migration</h3>

<p>I've been doing this migration slowly over the last 2 weeks.  Rather than wait for it to be complete, I put it up on nickmoline.com while leaving nick.pro operational, and put a status gauge on the home page indicating how much of the site had been migrated.  To prevent having to change this over and over manually, I did some simple trickery using Jekyll collections to <a href="2020-08-21-automating-progress-bar-in-jekyll">automate the gauge during Jekyll Builds</a>.  Be sure to check out <a href="2020-08-21-automating-progress-bar-in-jekyll">the post</a> for more on how I did this as well as to see what the gauge displayed over that time.</p>

<p>{% include migration-progress.html %}</p>

<h2>Much to do</h2>

<p>I still have much to do.  I've been debating on if I want to add retroactive posts or not to link to content that I never posted on my blog but did post in other places such as <a href="https://onward.justia.com/author/nickmoline/">Justia's Blog</a>, <a href="https://www.hp-lexicon.org/author/nickmoline/">The Harry Potter Lexicon</a>, or <a href="https://sunnyvaleplayers.org/author/nickmoline/">Sunnyvale Community Players</a> but never bothered to post about on my own blog.  As well as events that had a huge impact on my life but I never posted about such as the various plays I have worked on or some of the conferences I've attended.</p>

<p>At the moment I'm leaning towards writing those retroactive posts, or at least some of them, but I haven't done so yet.  And of course I intend on publishing lots of posts here in the future, especially on some of my more nerdy projects that I've been working on.</p>

<p>I also want to spend some more time better organizing the <a href="https://www.nickmoline.com/categories/">Categories</a> and <a href="https://www.nickmoline.com/tags/">Tags</a> a bit as there are more categories than I'd like and there are places where there are multiple tags with the same meaning but without the same posts.  These tasks will come.</p>

<p>But in the mean time <strong>Welcome to NickMoline.com</strong>, I'm very glad to have you here.</p>

        <p>As I mentioned yesterday I'm moving posts over to Jekyll from my WordPress blog.  To get started, I used a wordpress plugin called simply <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/">Jekyll Exporter</a> to export all of my posts and pages into markdown files.  This worked pretty well, but since I want my site to be 100% <a href="https://amp.dev">AMP</a> Only, I decided that rather than just publishing them all I should make sure that none of the old markup (much of which has been migrated between 3 different platforms) ends up causing pages not to validate in the AMP Validator.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I decided not to wait till I had converted all 212 pages to go live at nickmoline.com, but in the vein of old Under Construction pages of the 90s I decided it would be neat to display a progress bar on how much of the backlog I've worked my way through.</p>

<p>{% include migration-progress.html %}</p>

<p>What's cool about this bar (which is shows up not only here, but also on the home page and in the previous blog post) is that it is being generated entirely dynamically from my jekyll repo.  I thought it would be interesting to explain how I got my repo to generate this dynamically in this post.</p>

<h3>Determining what is done</h3>

<p>Jekyll has a global array called <code>site.posts</code> which contains everything necessary to loop through all of the posts on the site.  In the <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid Template Language</a> (the templating engine <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/">Jekyll uses</a>), you can use <code>.size</code> to determine how many elements are in an array, including this list of posts.</p>

<p>This way I'm able to determine how many posts have been written.</p>

<h4>Determining what is not done</h4>

<p>Live posts in Jekyll are stored in a <code>_posts</code> folder.  There is also a <code>_drafts</code> folder which contains post drafts that you haven't finished yet, but there's a difference between drafts and what I'm doing here.  As such my first goal was to create a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/">Collection</a> of the posts that have not been migrated yet.  I moved all of the posts that I had not yet checked for formatting and placed them in a <code>_pending</code> folder, i then configured the collection by adding to my collections array in the <code>_config.yml</code> file like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yml">collections:
    pending:
        extends: _layouts.post
section: content
</code></pre>

<p>This now creates a new collection named <code>pending</code> which works much the same as the built in <code>posts</code>.  The list of pending posts are available in a separate array <code>site.pending</code> which I similarly can use <code>site.pending.size</code> to get a count of.</p>

<h4>Calculating Percentage</h4>

<p>I can now add the two values together to get a total count of posts both pending and live.</p>

<p>{% raw %}</p>

<pre><code class="language-liquid">{% assign total_post_count = site.posts.size | plus: site.pending.size | times: 1.0 %}
</code></pre>

<p>{% endraw %}</p>

<p>Math in Liquid is done with filters, so I take <code>site.posts.size</code> and I add with <code>| plus:</code> the <code>site.pending.size</code> to get a total count.  You'll notice I then multiply this by <code>1.0</code>.  The reason I do this is to make sure the <code>total_post_count</code> variable is a floating point number, rather than an integer.</p>

<p>To get the percentage, I can then divide <code>site.posts.size</code> by <code>total_post_count</code>.</p>

<p>{% raw %}</p>

<pre><code class="language-liquid">{% assign migration_percentage = site.posts.size | divided_by: total_post_count | times: 100 | round: 2 %}
</code></pre>

<p>{% endraw %}</p>

<p>For presentation's sake I'm then multiplying by 100 and then rounding to 2 significant digits.  At this point I have all of the numbers I need.  I know how many published posts there are (currently <strong>##</strong>), how many posts are pending migration (<strong>##</strong>), how many posts there are total (<strong>##</strong>), and what percentage of the total posts are done (<strong>##%</strong>).</p>

<h3>Rendering the progress bar</h3>

<p>The progress bar itself I'm rendering using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5-author/the-progress-element.html">HTML5 tag progress element</a> which is specifically designed for rendering this.</p>

<p>{% raw %}</p>

<pre><code class="language-liquid">&lt;progress 
    max="{{ total_post_count | floor }}" 
    value="{{ site.posts.size }}" 
    title="{{ migration_percentage }}% migrated"
    &gt;&lt;/progress&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>{% endraw %}</p>

<p>I could have set <code>max</code> to <code>100</code> and used the <code>migration_percentage</code> as the <code>value</code>, but I thought using the actual values would make for a more accurate status bar as it would be calculated with a higher precision than I want to display.  I then set a title attribute so that when you hover over the progress bar you see the percentage.</p>

<p>For styling the progress bar, I followed the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/html5-progress-element/">fantastic guide posted at css-tricks</a> by <a href="http://pankajparashar.com/">Panjak Parashar</a> and then tweaked things a bit to my personal liking.</p>

<p>So that I can easily include this in multiple places, I stored all of this in an include file named migration-progress.html so that I could include it in multiple places (such as the [home page]({{ $page->baseUrl }}) and [my previous blog post]({{ $page->postUrl("2020-08-20-migrating-to-jekyll") }})) and future tweaks could be shown in multiple places.</p>

<h3>Putting it all together</h3>

<p><amp-gist
    data-gistid="2744c66ccd46224b7c6e3a8196d73a30"
    layout="fixed-height"
    height="225"></amp-gist></p>

<h3>Dealing with future posts</h3>

<p>At this point some of you may have noticed a flaw in the above that this post actually exacerbates, it counts new posts as migrated posts.  The more I blog before the files are published, the more the numbers will be incorrect.  To solve this, when I finished I simply replaced the calculation making the total a fixed number (212) and calculating the number published as the total minus what is left in the pending folder.</p>

<p>Here is the final modified version to take this into consideration.</p>

<p>{% raw %}</p>

<pre><code class="language-liquid">{% assign total_post_count = 212.0 %}
{% assign posts_migrated_count = total_post_count | minus: site.pending.size %}
{% assign migration_percentage = posts_migrated_count | divided_by: total_post_count | times: 100 | round: 2 %}
&lt;progress max="{{ total_post_count | floor }}" 
    value="{{ posts_migrated_count }}" 
    title="{{ migration_percentage }}% migrated"&gt;&lt;/progress&gt;
Migrated &lt;strong&gt;{{ posts_migrated_count | floor }}&lt;/strong&gt; 
out of &lt;strong&gt;{{ total_post_count | floor }}&lt;/strong&gt; posts migrated (&lt;strong&gt;{{ migration_percentage }}%&lt;/strong&gt;).  
&lt;strong&gt;{{ site.pending.size }}&lt;/strong&gt; posts remaining to migrate.
</code></pre>

<p>{% endraw %}</p>

<h3>UPDATE 2020-08-27</h3>

<p>I've finished the migration, migrating all of the 212 posts from my old blog, as such I've flipped the gauges that you see on this page and others to a fixed 100% complete gauge.  While this code worked very well, there's no reason for it to be making additional math updates now that it is always going to come across as 100%.  The code snips above are still how to make the gauge dynamic.</p>

        <p>After several years of using <a href="https://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> as my blogging platform of choice, I've made the decision to move my personal site to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll static site generator</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2>Why I'm doing this</h2>

<h3>Super Fast</h3>

<p>As I've blogged about on Justia's Legal Marketing &amp; Technology Blog several times, <a href="https://onward.justia.com/2017/07/05/page-speed-tips-and-tools/">web performance matters</a>.  47% of users expect a web page to load in under 2 seconds, and 40% of users will abandon a page that takes longer than 3 seconds to load.</p>

<p>WordPress is a fantastic blogging platform, and it is possible using a combination of best practices, extensive hosting infrastructure, and plugins such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/">W3 Total Cache</a> to make WordPress pages perform very well.  But nothing is faster than serving static files that require no server side code to view.</p>

<p>While I know quite a bit about optimizing WordPress, having done it for years, I've never bothered to spend any significant time optimizing this blog, and frankly it is not the best use of my time to do so.</p>

<h3>Infrastructure Light</h3>

<p>I mentioned that part of making a WordPress powered site perform optimally is having the server infrastructure in place to handle the demand.  This means a web server with plenty of CPU available for the code, and a MySQL server with plenty of CPU and Ram to handle requests quickly.  You then also have to be careful not to weigh your blog down with too many plugins that may impact performance.</p>

<p>For my own personal site, which doesn't make money, investing in this infrastructure to keep this site performing optimally would not be an efficient use of my money.</p>

<p>GitHub offers a free service called <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> which can host free static html sites on their servers.  While I've never had a problem running my own server (and still do for advanced projects), for my blog in particular I'd love to not have to worry about maintaining the server.  Since the output from jekyll is static html pages, the limitations of GitHub Pages (basically no server side code or database) are not a problem and it can handle this easily.</p>

<p>What's more is that GitHub pages supports jekyll natively, meaning that while I <em>can</em> serve Jekyll pages anywhere on any web server, I don't even have to run the builder to process the files when hosting them on GitHub Pages.</p>

<h3>Coder Friendly</h3>

<p>As a coder I'm comfortable working in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, especially the derivitive known as <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a> which adds a number of coder friendly improvements over the top of the <a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/current/">CommonMark spec</a>.</p>

<p>As Jekyll sites are built from a markdown base (by default, you can also use plugins to build from other markup languages or just use plain html files) I'm able to author posts very quickly.</p>

<p>GitHub Pages and <abbr title="GitHub Flavored Markdown">GFM</abbr> allows me to integrate features from GitHub into my pages very simply.  For example I can easily <a href="https://gist.github.com/">embed a gist</a> in a page with a simple tag.  And I can insert code into my pages with syntax hilighting that matches the syntax hilighting on GitHub.  As like many developers I host my code repositories on GitHub, this makes it very easy to blog about my coding exploits.</p>

<p>Another interesting feature of GitHub Pages is that I can <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/using-submodules-with-github-pages">host documentation pages for my own GitHub hosted projects</a> by using Git Submodules to embed the other github hosted repo in a subfolder of this.  As I work on more open source projects I intend on hosting my documentation on this site using this feature.</p>

<h3>Version Controlled Site</h3>

<p>I love the idea of version controlling my live site, it allows me to see my edits over time.  This blog is now hosted on a <a href="https://github.com/nickmoline/nickmoline.github.io">public repo</a> on my GitHub account @nickmoline.</p>

<p>This makes it very easy to track what changes I've made over time, both to the layout of the site and even the content of individual pages.  It allows me all of the power of the <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> Version Control System over my own content.</p>

<h2>I still love WordPress</h2>

<p>I've thought about doing this many times over the years.  What held me back is that I happen to love WordPress.  I'm not alone in this, as of the time I'm writing this, <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress">38.1% of all websites are hosted on WordPress</a> accounting for 63.5% of websites hosted by a known <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> according to W3techs.  When over a third of all websites in the world are powered by WordPress, there is a good reason for that.  WordPress is extremely flexible allowing you to host any type of website from a blog like this one to a fully fledged eCommerce site using freely available plugins to add functionality needed for a particular site.</p>

<p>I still use WordPress in a number of projects both for work and for personal side projects such as <a href="https://www.hp-lexicon.org/">The Harry Potter Lexicon</a> and the website for <a href="https://sunnyvaleplayers.org">Sunnyvale Community Players</a>.</p>

<h2>Migration Progress</h2>

<p>Rather than dump all of the posts at once, I'm taking the time to go through the posts and fix the formatting to match the new layout.  For your amusement, here is the migration progress statistics:</p>

<p>{% include migration-progress.html %}</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>This morning as a team building exercise, the Engineering Team at Justia took personality tests at the website <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/rx7hf4vd2isxptg/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-26%20at%201.08.18%20PM.png?dl=0">16 Personalities</a> and shared our results.  In the early days of this blog (was called Cap's Log back then) I took some online <a href="https://www.nickmoline.com/tags/#personality-test">personality tests</a> from time to time and posted my results here, so I thought I'd do the same here.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This is a much more modern take on the Personality Test system than the ones I did between 2003 and <a href="2006-05-30-personality-test">2006</a>.  Instead of focusing on a large number of attributes they focus on 5 characteristic pairs, and represent each pair as scale between the 2 extremes.</p>

<p>The pairs are categorized as:
* <strong>Mind:</strong> <em>Introverted</em> vs. <em>Extroverted</em>
* <strong>Energy:</strong> <em>Intuitive</em> vs. <em>Observant</em>
* <strong>Nature:</strong> <em>Thinking</em> vs. <em>Feeling</em>
* <strong>Tactics:</strong> <em>Judging</em> vs. <em>Prospecting</em>
* <strong>Identity:</strong> <em>Assertive</em> vs. <em>Turbulent</em></p>

<p>They then summarize these attributes into one of 16 personality types (hense the name), a code, a role, and a strategy.</p>

<p>After taking the test I was <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/4f9a7cf0b6da1">graded overall</a> as follows:</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>| Type:     | Turbulent <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality">Mediator</a>   |
| Code:     | INFP-T                 |
| Role:     | <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/roles-diplomats">Diplomat</a>             |
| Strategy: | <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/strategies-constant-improvement">Constant Improvement</a> |</p>

<h3>Mind: <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Introverted</a> (82%)</h3>

<p>The mind category is the one personality characteristic everyone knows, "Introverted" vs "Extroverted."  I'm not surprised to find out that I'm graded as mostly an Introvert, <strong>82% <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Introverted</a></strong> and 18% Extroverted.  Being an introvert doesn't mean I don't like people or that I don't like being around people, quite the contrary.  As an Introvert I make a relatively few friendships but those friendships I do cultivate are very deep friendships.</p>

<h3>Energy: <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Intuitive</a> (73%)</h3>

<p>In the energy category I came out as <strong>73% <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Intuitive</a></strong> and 27% Observant.  An Intuitive person is described as being imaginative, open minded, and curious.  I think this describes me very well.  When I'm faced with a challenge, I look at things from multiple angles, keeping an open mind, and am able to come up with creative and inventive solutions to problems.  I also love when I'm faced with something new, which really does energize me.</p>

<h3>Nature: <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Feeling</a> (86%)</h3>

<p>This one surprised me a bit.  At <strong>86% <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Feeling</a></strong> versus only 14% Thinking, I clearly come across as more emotional than I expected.  The description however does make sense.  I am generally sensitive to what people are thinking and I can't stand people putting each other down competitively rather than working together cooperatively.</p>

<h3>Tactics: <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Prospecting</a> (61%)</h3>

<p>Compared to the other categories, I'm much closer to the center on this.  My <strong>61% <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Prospecting</a></strong> score still clearly beats out the 39% Judging, but I think I do have aspects of both in this.  In general Prospecting individuals are good at improvisation and spotting opportunities.  It is my ability to be flexible that is one of my strongest traits, as well as my strongest weakness.  Fortunately I do have a fairly strong Judging trait as well, which insists on getting things right.</p>

<h3>Identity: <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/identity-assertive-vs-turbulent">Turbulent</a> (90%)</h3>

<p>This one is no contest.  <strong>90% <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/identity-assertive-vs-turbulent">Turbulent</a></strong> easily demolishes the 10% Assertive.  I feel this is something I need to actually work on, be slightly less Turbulent (which is self conscious and sensitive to stress) and be more Assertive (self assured and resistant to stress).  I insist on success and when I fail (which I do) I beat myself up about it, which raises my stress level.</p>

<h2>Life as a Mediator</h2>

<p>The <strong>I</strong>ntroverted I<strong>n</strong>tuitive <strong>F</strong>eeling <strong>P</strong>rospecting life of a <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality">Mediator</a> means I always want to find the good in people, and I want to help others succeed, and this is true about me.  I'm creative and filled with passion, guided by my principles.  I'm a perfectionist who wants things to be perfect and works to get there.</p>

<p>One of my favorite parts of the personality assessment is where it compares my results with famous real and fictional people to indicate others who share characteristics like me.  Other historical and celebrity <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality">Mediator</a>s include William Shakespeare, <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/jrr-tolkien-creator-of-words-and-worlds-the-lord-of-the-rings-personality-series">J.R.R. Tolkien</a>, Johnny Depp, and Julia Roberts.  Fictional Characters who match the Mediator personality type include both Frodo Baggins and Arwen from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, Anne from <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>, and Fox Mulder from <em>The X-Files</em>.</p>

<p>With some thought I can see how these people, both real and imagined, have characteristics that match me, and perhaps it is why I'm drawn to some of these specific characters often.  In the <em>Rings</em> Trilogy I'm drawn to Arwen more than any of the other elves (even <em>Elrond</em>), and while I thought my reason for being fascinated with Frodo was because he is the central character, I realize it is really because of the way he acts in situations being familiar to me.  And with Tolkien being a Mediator as well, it makes sense that his central character would have similar characteristics.  Shakespeare was the master of understanding the emotion behind his characters.  And in a similar way Johnny Depp is so creative and quirky, he chooses roles that require him to express emotion, his characters all tend to be loners (Introverts).</p>

<h3>Life as a Turbulent Mediator</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/identity-assertive-vs-turbulent">Turbulent</a> trait on top of the Mediator means I am driven by success not just for me but for others as well, and I don't take failure well.  This is true and something I need to work on.</p>

<p>It was an interesting experiment to take this personality disorder quiz and see how I stacked up against my colleagues.  I'll have to take this again sometime and see if any of those percentages have changed.</p>

        <p>Barbara and I attended the Google I/O 2019 developer conference earlier this month. We&#8217;ve attended the conference every year since the first in 2008. I also attended its predecessor, the original <a href="2007-06-03-google-developer-day-2007">Google Developer Day</a> the year before. This marks my 13th annual general Google Developer conference, and my 12th Google I/O specifically.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Google keeps altering the form a bit. In 2016 they moved the conference from being an indoor conference at Moscone Center in San Francisco to a mostly outdoor &#8220;festival&#8221; at the Shoreline Amphitheatre.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still not a fan of the outdoor festival over the indoor conference, as it presents a number of problems. These problems include: sunburn, pushing the wheelchair all over the place over uneven terrain, and lack of power outlets.</p>

<p>They continue to learn from each year&#8217;s conference and make adjustments that fix some of the larger problems. For example after the first year, sunscreen was provided everywhere throughout the conference to help with the sunburn problems. They also made session rooms larger and introduced a reservation system so that people didn&#8217;t have to wait for sessions out in the sun for long periods of time.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t cover the big announcements from Google I/O 2019 in this post. <a href="https://onward.justia.com/2019/05/30/thoughts-from-google-i-o-2019/">I covered them over on Justia&#8217;s blog</a>. There are, however, some things I wanted to cover that I couldn&#8217;t really cover on the other blog.</p>

<h2>Particularly Inspiring Sessions from Google I/O 2019</h2>

<p>This year, there was a change in the focus of a lot of the sessions. There were still sessions about changed Google APIs and products and how to use them. But, there were also a number of sessions that were there to inspire developers to make great things. Some of them didn&#8217;t even have to do with Google services.</p>

<p>Here are some of the sessions from Google I/O 2019 that I found the most inspiring:</p>

<h3>Teaching a Car to Drive Itself by Imitation and Imagination</h3>

<p><strong>Teaching a Car to Drive Itself by Imitation and Imagination</strong> was a session hosted by Mayank Bansal of <a href="https://waymo.com/">Waymo</a>. I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect from this session, since Waymo doesn&#8217;t yet have any public APIs or services a developer could use. I wasn&#8217;t expecting the session to be a deep dive into explaining the process that the Waymo team followed to train the machine learning models that allow their self driving cars to work.</p>

<p>He explained the pitfalls that the team came across when doing the project, and didn&#8217;t shy away from the ways the team failed in their early attempts. This was an absolutely fascinating session, and extremely inspiring.</p>

<h3>Stadia Streaming Tech: A Deep Dive</h3>

    height="270"</p>

  <p></amp-youtube></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This session pleasantly surprised me as well. <a href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/stadia?hl=en-US">Stadia</a> is Google&#8217;s new Streaming Gaming product that will come out later this year (announced back at the Game Developer Conference earlier this year). I assumed this session would be aimed at game developers wanting to develop for the service. Instead, the session was a deep dive into streaming technology as a whole and just how they changed the way streaming video works to reduce latency as much as possible.</p>

<p>It went into the fundamentals of how streaming has worked historically and how they have changed it to fit this particular use case.</p>

<h3>Sound Design and Sonic Brand</h3>

<p>In addition to being a Software Engineer at Justia, I also work with a non-profit Community Theater group called <a href="https://www.sunnyvaleplayers.org/">Sunnyvale Community Players</a>. I help SCP put on several musical theater productions a year. On most shows I&#8217;ve worked on, I work as either a Sound Designer or a Sound Engineer. As such, when I saw a session about Sound Design on the agenda for Google I/O 2019, I didn&#8217;t hesitate a second to reserve my spot.</p>

<p>This session was a fantastic session on Sonic Branding and creating sound effects and I for one found it particularly interesting. <a href="https://twitter.com/conor">Conor O&#8217;Sullivan</a> is a sound designer at Google and is responsible for a lot of the sounds that you barely notice but are crucial to your google experience. Things like the boot up sound on Google home, or all the clicks, boops, beeps and whistles you hear when using an Android phone or a Google app on any phone.</p>

<p>The session was filled with guidelines on how to approach sound design for a product, which is a bit different than sound design for a musical, but many of the same rules apply. Google has compiled these guidelines and more into a set of <a href="https://material.io/design/sound/">Material Sound Design</a> guidelines which is excellent reading (and listening) for anyone working with sound.</p>

<h3>On Creativity and Technology, with Legendary Animator Glen Keane</h3>

<p>&lt;amp-youtube
    data-videoid="qL4U9Ygtxh8"
    layout="responsive"
    width="480"

  <p></amp-youtube></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a very personal report from former Disney animator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Keane">Glen Keane</a>, explaining how someone most known for using a pencil and paper to create characters such as Ariel (from <em>The Little Mermaid</em>) and the Beast (from <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>) could learn to embrace technology and demonstrating how technology fosters creativity. The session was deeply moving, and it was powerful just being in the same room as this incredibly creative individual.</p>

<p>As a fan of both Technology and Disney Animation, this was definitely a session that I was excited about. I unfortunately got there late because of traffic, but I&#8217;ve rewatched the video to catch what I missed, and now so can you.</p>

<p>Sessions don&#8217;t get any more inspiring this session with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku">Michio Kaku</a>, the co-founder of String Field Theory and one of the most intelligent people in the world. This interview and Q&amp;A session left everyone in the room thinking about what the future holds, not just with technology, but with the mind, education, and more.</p>

<p>A massive standing ovation ended the session.</p>

<h2>My Google I/O 2019 Live Blogs</h2>

<p>This year I live blogged 7 sessions for Justia&#8217;s Legal Marketing &amp; Technology Blog. I started doing this 2 years ago at Google I/O 2017. I used a different service this year from years past. The <a href="https://www.arena.im">arena.im</a> service I tried out this year actually has an AMP compatible embed, so for the first time the live blogs could work in AMP.</p>

<p>Here are the sessions from Google I/O 2019 I live blogged:</p>

<h3>Thoughts on the arena.im service</h3>

<p>arena.im also had an advantage in that it had a pretty good mobile app. I had Barbara take pictures for me while I focused on taking notes. Barbara signed into the app on her own phone while I signed in on my laptop to take notes.</p>

<p>The service also had a nifty feature that allowed me to connect my twitter account. Whenever I would tweet something with the #io19 hashtag during one of my live blog sessions, it would automatically post the tweet into the live stream.</p>

<p>Overall arena.im worked well, though I did have problems in one of the sessions. About a third of the way through the session, the twitter feature malfunctioned. Instead of just posting <em>my</em> tweets with the #io19 hashtag, it was posting tweets from anyone using the #io19 hashtag. What&#8217;s more, turning the feature off wouldn&#8217;t stop the deluge. I spent most of my time during that session deleting tweets from the live stream that shouldn&#8217;t have been there.</p>

<p>After that issue, I disabled the automatic posting of tweets feature for the rest of the conference. Instead, I had it pull up a stream of tweets in a panel. Whenever I would tweet something that I wanted to also post, I&#8217;d hit the post button from there. This way I was in control of what ended up in the liveblog.</p>

<h3>What could be better</h3>

<p>I liked arena.im and I&#8217;d probably use it again, but I wish I could find a service that would handle the AMP embed using <a href="https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-live-list"><code>amp-live-list</code></a> instead of just using <a href="https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-iframe"><code>amp-iframe</code></a>. With <code>amp-live-list</code> the entire live blog post would be AMP and I could actually style the output to meet my needs. Also arena.im doesn&#8217;t seem to have an export feature.</p>

<p>After an event, I like to turn my live-blogs into normal blog posts that don&#8217;t need external resources to work. This is generally better for SEO and it is faster to load and easier to style.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started converting my live blogs from this year. It is slow going, though, since I have to manually re-create the stream.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts from Google I/O 2019</h2>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/05/MVIMG_20190507_083220-1-e1559243854902.webp" alt="Nick and Barbara showing their Google Fandom as they wait for the Google I/O 2019 Keynote to begin" width="2519" height="1572"  layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/05/MVIMG_20190507_083220-1-e1559243854902.jpg" alt="Nick and Barbara showing their Google Fandom as they wait for the Google I/O 2019 Keynote to begin" width="2519" height="1572"  layout="responsive" lightbox></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>Google I/O is a high point of my year, every year for the last 13 years. I show my excitement for it by doing crazy things like coloring my hair. Barbara even does face paint to celebrate.</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s conference felt different from recent years past. I still got sun burned in spite of tons of sunscreen. Yes, I still ended each day so exhausted that I could barely walk to my bedroom. But it has been a long time since I&#8217;ve left Google I/O feeling so inspired. Inspired to make great things, to push the future of technology, and to follow that great adage:</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/05/MVIMG_20190507_093246-1.webp" alt="The quote &quot;If at first you don't succeed, sudo&quot; appeared on the main screen as we waited for the Google I/O 2019 Keynote address"  width="4032" height="3024" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/05/MVIMG_20190507_093246-1.jpg" alt="The quote &quot;If at first you don't succeed, sudo&quot; appeared on the main screen as we waited for the Google I/O 2019 Keynote address"  width="4032" height="3024" layout="responsive" lightbox></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>Never give up. Push the limits of creativity and animation like Glen Keane. Teach a car to drive itself like Waymo. Solve the greatest mysteries of the universe like Michio Kaku. Whatever you do, keep moving forward.</p>

<p>I had a great time at Google I/O 2019 and I&#8217;m looking forward to Google I/O 2020.</p>

<p>In this article I review Slack, Stride/HipChat, Flock, and Chanty.

        <p>Today, August 10th, is my 35th birthday.  I have to say this is the first birthday where I&#8217;ve actually felt &#8220;old.&#8221;  I realize the many friends I have who are older than me probably think that is silly, but to me this seems like a real benchmark year.  It makes me feel like I should come up with some numbers to quantify my life.  Note I&#8217;m sticking to things that have numbers here, not listing specific life events unless it is to count them.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2>Where I&#8217;ve Lived my Life</h2>

<p>Of the <strong>12,785 days</strong> I&#8217;ve been alive, I&#8217;ve lived in the following states:</p>

<table class="wp-block-table">
    <tr>
        <td>California<sup>*</sup></td>
        <td><strong>7,484</strong> days</td>
        <td>58.537%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Texas<sup>*</sup></td>
        <td><strong>2,967</strong> days</td>
        <td>23.207%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Florida<sup>*</sup></td>
        <td><strong>182</strong> days</td>
        <td>1.423%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Virginia</td>
        <td><strong>1,957</strong> days</td>
        <td>15.307%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>North Carolina</td>
        <td><strong>194</strong> days</td>
        <td>1.517%</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/08/nickslifebystate-e1502403863541.webp" alt="My Life by State"  width="546" height="362" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/08/nickslifebystate-e1502403863541.png" alt="My Life by State"  width="546" height="362" layout="responsive" lightbox></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p><small><em><sup>*</sup> Note, when I was very young I spent 6 months each in Texas and Florida.  Since I do not have the precise move in and out days for those locations, I&#8217;m estimating under the assumption that I spent half a year in each location (182 days, giving the extra 1 day back to California).  I likely did not spend exactly 182 days in each of Florida and Texas, so the exact number of days for California, Texas and Florida may be slightly off.</em></small></p>

<p>By far the longest of these locations is California at 58% of my life, or just under <strong>20 and a half years</strong>, followed by Texas at 23% of my life (<strong>8.1 years</strong>).  If you instead split this up into individual segments of time I&#8217;ve lived in individual places, California still wins with this most recent move to California I&#8217;ve been here <strong>3,949 days</strong> so far which is more than the total of all of the time spent in Texas across the <strong>3 times</strong> I lived there.</p>

<h2>What I&#8217;ve Done <strong>with</strong> My Life</h2>

<p><strong>3,948</strong> of those days I&#8217;ve been employed at Justia meaning I&#8217;ve worked for Justia for <strong>30.88%</strong> of my life.  Prior to that, I worked a variety of jobs for a number of companies, including a stint trying to run my own hosting company for a while.</p>

<p>Slightly longer than I&#8217;ve worked for Justia, <strong>4,058 days</strong> or <strong>31.740%</strong> of my life, I&#8217;ve been married to my wife Barbara and she has made my life richer and filled it with love these <strong>11 years, 1 month, and 8 days</strong>.</p>

<h2>What I&#8217;ve Done <strong>in</strong> My Life</h2>

<p>In these 35 years, I&#8217;ve gotten to do or be a part of a lot of great things.  I&#8217;ve acted in <strong>2</strong> plays, while working tech for <strong>5</strong> more, and I have at least <strong>2</strong> more planned soon (<em>Fiddler on the Roof</em> is in rehearsals right now and I&#8217;ll be working sound for it, as well as <em>Avenue Q</em> after that).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gotten to attend <strong>2</strong> Stanley Cup final games (once in Chicago, once here in San Jose), <strong>2</strong> World Series Games (both in San Francisco), and a number of playoff games for both the <em>San Francisco Giants</em> and the <em>San Jose Sharks,</em> as well as too many other great non-playoff games to count.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gotten to see <strong>12</strong> Broadway musical professional performances (<strong>4</strong> in San Francisco, <strong>2</strong> in San Jose, <strong>3</strong> on Broadway in New York, <strong>2</strong> in Las Vegas, and <strong>1</strong> in Chicago).  I already have my tickets purchased to see another professional production in November (<em>Aladdin</em>), which will bring the professional production count up to <strong>13</strong>, as well as bumping the San Francisco number to <strong>5</strong>.  <em>Note that <strong>3</strong> of those performances were separate performances of the same play (Wicked), so I&#8217;ve only seen professional performances of <strong>10</strong> distinct musicals.</em></p>

<h2>What has Happened in My Lifetime</h2>

<p>There have been <strong>6</strong> US Presidents in my lifetime (Reagan started his first term the year before I was born), <strong>194</strong> of the <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic.htm">top 200 movies by domestic box office</a> have been released in my lifetime (<em>E.T.</em>, the number 15 on the list, came out 2 months before I was born).  If you <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm">adjust for inflation</a>, this number goes down to <strong>124</strong>.</p>

<h2>Other Random Numbers</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="http://you.regettingold.com/10/08/1982/Tmljaw/">You&#8217;re Getting Old</a> site, I&#8217;ve had a total of <strong>630</strong> candles on birthday cakes (assuming I always got a cake with individual year candles on it, which I didn&#8217;t), the moon has orbited the earth <strong>468</strong> times since I was born, and the population of Earth increased <strong>60.357%</strong> from <strong>4,662,143,140</strong> to over <strong>7,476,065,380</strong>.</p>

<h2>About that Picture</h2>

<p>The Featured photo for this post was one of the birthday desserts Disneyland gave me while I was there celebrating last week.  This chocolate mousse was incredibly delicious and it was super cute too.  The dessert itself comes with the <em>Fantasmic</em> Dining Package at the Blue Bayou.  The meal was delicious and the reserved viewing area for people who ate at the Blue Bayou had a fantastic vantage point to watch the newly revamped <em>Fantasmic</em> show.</p>

        <p>For a small business, it can be hard to decide which tech products and services you want to use to solve the various needs of your employees and clients.  To that end I've started a <a href="https://onward.justia.com/tag/the-collaborative-law-firm/">new series</a> of posts on Justia's Legal Marketing &amp; Technology Blog to help business owners make an informed decision for their business.</p>

<p>While the series is aimed at Law Firms, it contains helpful comparisons that are helpful to any small business.  The <a href="https://onward.justia.com/2017/07/28/collaborative-law-firm-instant-messaging/">first post</a> in this series is about Instant Messaging services.  I review several mainstream services (Skype, Google Hangouts, Facebook Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger, and Yahoo Messenger), as well as business hosted services (Skype for Business, GSuite Hangouts), and even describe how you can host your own instant messaging service within your company using XMPP.</p>

        <p>This past weekend I had the absolute privilege of running sound for <a href="https://www.therefugetheater.com/">The Refuge</a>&#8216;s first show, Next to Normal. When the opportunity was sent to me, I hesitated, it was going to be a real challenge, no lengthy week of tech/dress rehearsals to get sound right, unknown sound equipment in an unknown space, and no orchestra pit meaning the band is on stage which makes controlling the audio levels much more difficult. On top of this, the show was in San Francisco, meaning I&#8217;d have a long commute to and from the show each day.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I&#8217;m so glad I decided to take the opportunity. The Refuge is an interesting concept of a theater company. Daniel Shaindlin has tried to come up with a way that the best college actors can get an experience to act in a professionally produced show. The group of students that he brought together for this show is absolutely incredible. If these young men and women don&#8217;t end up on Broadway or in Hollywood, the arts will have lost out on some real talent.</p>

<p>If you didn&#8217;t read that these were college students and just came to the show, you would believe these were old pros who have been belting it out on the Broadway stage for years. Heck, they are better than many of the actors I&#8217;ve actually seen on Broadway and other professional productions.</p>

<p>&lt;amp-youtube
    data-videoid="zfdsYB8Oa-I"
    layout="responsive"
    width="480"
    height="270"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p></amp-youtube></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On top of this, to make the show as amazing as possible, our extremely talented Music Director Kevin Surace told Daniel that this show needed professional musicians. This show is an extremely challenging one to play and the timeline to produce it was going to be extremely short. Kevin knew that this group of actors deserved to be backed by an Orchestra that was ready and able to play this music. The musicians they hired for this show have toured, they&#8217;ve played concert halls and stages around the world and it shows.</p>

<p>As I said above, when Kevin first emailed me to ask if I was interested in running sound for this show I hesitated. &nbsp;The challenges were going to be immense, and it would require a ton of energy that I wasn&#8217;t sure I had. &nbsp;When he described the talent of these practically professional actors and these already professional musicians, my self doubt&nbsp;told me I wasn&#8217;t up to the level this show deserved. &nbsp;Finally there was the play itself.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_to_Normal">Next to Normal</a> before this, but looking it up showed that the subject matter was, heavy. &nbsp;The play covers a family who is in turmoil as the wife/mother battles with Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, and delusions. &nbsp;The main character deals with the grief of losing a child, the crippling grip of mental disorders, attempted suicide, electroconvulsive therapy, memory loss and more. &nbsp;Simultaneously we see the rest of the family as they try to care for and protect their suffering loved one, and we see the heavy toll it places on all of them and the way it pushes her daughter to abuse drugs.</p>

<p>As some of my friends and family know, I suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</a> myself. &nbsp;I currently take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion">Bupropion</a> to treat this. &nbsp;While it helps a lot, I go through bouts of severe depression when it doesn&#8217;t work well enough for me. &nbsp;When I read the synopsis of this play I was worried that if I worked this play, the heavy subject matter might feed my own depression, making it worse. &nbsp;Part of the reason I love musical theater so much is because it offers me an escape from my depression for a few hours, and this play seemed like it would do the opposite.</p>

<p>All this said, when Kevin&nbsp;contacted me a second time, I decided to see if I could fit it into my schedule. &nbsp;It was going to be difficult, but I decided that it was an opportunity I didn&#8217;t want to pass up. &nbsp;My life is forever enriched from this experience. &nbsp;Last night, even though it was the fifth time in 4 days that I had seen this play, the performance moved me to tears it was so incredible. &nbsp;Everything from the voices, to the music, to the emotion these amazing actors put behind every word.</p>

<p>I clearly wasn&#8217;t the only person to think so, last night, a packed house at the historic <a href="http://www.victoriatheatre.org/">Victoria Theatre</a> in San Francisco gave this cast a well-deserved standing ovation that lasted several minutes.</p>

<p>Thank you, Kevin Surace, for thinking of me when you needed a sound operator for this show. &nbsp;Thank you, Daniel Shaindlin, for allowing me to be a part of this. &nbsp;I will watch The Refuge and eagerly await your next show. &nbsp;For those of you in the bay area, next time <a href="https://www.therefugetheater.com/">The Refuge</a> puts on a production, be sure to put it on your must-see list, I know I will.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed from my last few short posts here, I&#8217;ve been <a href="https://onward.justia.com/author/nickmoline/">doing more writing</a> over on Justia&#8217;s Legal Marketing &amp; Technology Blog this year than in years past and as such I proposed the idea of live blogging sessions at Google I/O this year. &nbsp;My suggestion was readily approved and I set to work on <a href="https://onward.justia.com/2017/05/10/google-io-2017-live-blog/">planning which sessions I would Live Blog</a>.</p>

<p>In the end I Live Blogged 7 &nbsp;sessions over the course of the 3 day conference and wanted to make sure those that follow me on my personal blog knew about them. &nbsp;Check out the list of sessions I ended up blogging, with links over to the individual live blog posts after the break.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p><em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</em> is a bit of an unusual entry into the Harry Potter canon.  Not being a novel makes it a completely different reading experience than the core 7 books that we love, being written by multiple people (rather than just J.K. Rowling) makes some of the characters have a slightly different feel, and centering the story on a character other than Harry makes it inherently feel different.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I for one loved reading it and I look forward to the day I can eventually see the play itself to experience it the way it was designed to be experienced, but not everyone agrees with me.  People speak out against the differences in Time Travel between this story and <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em>.  People speak out against the differences in the way Ron Weasley is characterized.  I tend to disagree with them, I think Ron seems perfectly normal and <a href="https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2016/08/10/albus-potter-lesson-quantum-mechanics/">the Time Travel is consistent</a> with the warning Hermione gives to Harry in <em>Prisoner of Askaban</em>.</p>

<p>One thing that has been hitting the media lately is a statement by a few people that “<a href="http://mashable.com/2016/08/17/harry-potter-cursed-child-female-characters/#dtI_uy7hyGqi"><em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</em> lets down women and betrays Hermione’s legacy</a>” (Mashable) or “<a href="http://www.bustle.com/articles/177505-how-hermione-granger-is-portrayed-in-harry-potter-the-cursed-child-is-offensive-to-the">How Hermione Granger Is Portrayed in <em>Harry Potter &amp; The Cursed Child</em> is Offensive To The Fans &amp; The Character</a>.” (Bustle).</p>

<p>As with the other claims, I disagree with this assessment and <a href="https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2016/10/10/minister-teacher-either-way-hermione-still-awesome/">wrote an Essay for the Harry Potter Lexicon</a> to dispute it.  Please give it a read and see if you agree with me or not.</p>

        <p>I have friends and colleagues from both parties, and I just choose to keep my opinions on political matters private as there are so many people who are much better than me at articulating the political issues. Choosing to talk about my beliefs would normally incite arguments, and my time on social media is better spent talking about things that people would only tease me for rather than argue with me.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>If you pay attention to my various streams, you&#8217;ll note I purposely stay away from posting about politics or other hot-button issues. I haven&#8217;t posted in the <a href="https://www.nick.pro/category/politics/">Politics category</a> of this blog since 2004, and that wasn&#8217;t so much about politics as it was about the <a href="https://www.nick.pro/2004/10/30/ben-fix-legislature/">way the Legislative Branch of the government is organized</a>.</p>

<p>Every election I exercise my right to vote and express my political beliefs through that medium. This election, however, has become such a sham that I feel I can remain silent no longer.</p>

<p>Since before I even had the right to vote, I&#8217;ve identified myself as Republican. My primary reason for this is that as I was growing up, it was the Republican candidates who agreed most with me on issues that are of particular importance to me. I&#8217;m not going to talk about these issues here because they very well would incite some of those arguments I was talking about, and I agree to disagree with some my friends.</p>

<p>That said, I&#8217;ve never simply voted along party lines for the sake of voting Republican. Whenever possible I learn everything I can about what all candidates for each job believe in, and vote for the one that more expresses my views. Most of the time, this has been the Republican candidate, particularly in presidential elections. In fact, I can honestly tell you I&#8217;ve never voted for a Democratic Presidential Candidate.  I have voted for Democrats in other offices, but not for President.</p>

<p>The moment Donald Trump became the Republican nominee for the 2016 presidential campaign, that trend ended.  As the primary race continued, and every other option for the Republican party dropped out, and as Donald Trump&#8217;s outrageous comments continued to get worse, I watched in horror as my chosen political party backed a racist, sexist pig for President of the United States.</p>

<p>At first, some of the outrageous statements Trump made shocked me, calling Mexicans &#8220;rapists&#8221; in general, calling on &#8220;2nd amendment&#8221; advocates to &#8220;do something&#8221; about Hillary Clinton, and suggesting building the Great Wall of America and ridiculously thinking that Mexico will &#8220;gladly&#8221; pay for it.</p>

<p>At this point, however, nothing he says shocks me.  The only thing shocking about the recording of his lewd comments about women that was released on Friday is that anybody finds this shocking anymore.</p>

<p>Donald Trump says sexist things all the time, why is anyone shocked that he is sexist?  Donald Trump says racist things all the time, why would anybody be shocked that he is a racist?  Donald Trump says stupid things all the time, even with &#8220;the best words,&#8221; why would anybody be shocked that he is an idiot?</p>

<p>How could anyone, Republican or Democrat, Conservative or Liberal, want this man to have access to the nuclear football?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of Hilary Clinton, and yes, she has some controversies around her too, but when the other choice is Donald Trump, this Republican, this Conservative, this Christian will be voting for Hilary Clinton.  In the 2016 election <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ImWithHer&amp;src=tyah">#ImWithHer</a>.</p>

        <p>As I sit here today checking the time on my <a title="Moto 360" href="https://moto360.motorola.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moto 360</a> <a title="Android Wear" href="http://www.android.com/wear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android Wear</a> smartwatch, I&#8217;m amused by a concept I&#8217;m calling &#8220;<em>The Time Keeping Cycle</em>.&#8221;  When I was in high school college I wore watches all of the time (usually a Casio calculator watch, yes I was &#8220;that guy&#8221;), and pretty much everyone I knew wore wrist watches at the time as well.  They were simple and useful.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I&#8217;ve always been one to prefer function over form and even back then I longed for a watch that did more than just tell time.  That said though at some point in the early 2000s I stopped wearing watches (and so did most people).  The few people who still wear watches tend to wear them more as a fashion statement rather than as a utility device to tell time.</p>

<p>Why did everyone stop wearing watches?  Because pretty much everyone started carrying a cell phone around with them wherever they went, and in addition to keeping you in contact with the world around you, cell phones could also tell you the time (and be used as a calculator).  Now over the last couple of years, companies have been trying to get people back into wearing watches again with smart watches.  Thanks to Android Wear, they&#8217;ve finally convinced me.</p>

<p>It is interesting though that timepieces have moved from inside the pocket, to the wrist, back into the pocket, and now back to the wrist again.  For the enjoyment of anyone who cares, I&#8217;m including a brief history of the watch, ending with my personal history with watches after the break.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/09/German_-_Spherical_Table_Watch_Melanchthons_Watch_-_Walters_5817_-_View_C.webp" alt="German - Spherical Table Watch (Melanchthon's Watch) - Walters 5817 - View C"  width="1800" height="1184" layout="responsive" title="German &#8211; Spherical Table Watch (Melanchthon&#8217;s Watch) &#8211; Walters 5817" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>The invention of the watch is usually credited to German clockmaker <a title="Peter Henlein" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter Henlein</a> in the early 1500s.  Henlein was one of the first to make what was known as <em>taschenuhr</em> or &#8220;clock-watches,&#8221; which was a clock worn as a pendant around the neck.</p>

<p>These early timepieces generally only had an hour hand, but often did include chimes or alarms for noting hours passing by.</p>

<p>The earliest dated known watch is the one seen here which is dated 1530.  It had a metal cover to protect the delicate hour hand.</p>

</amp-img></p>

<p>In the late 17th century, the watch got smaller and <a title="The History of Watches" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_watches#Pocketwatches" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">began to be kept in pockets</a>, rather than as pendants.  The pocketwatch remained in fashion for quite some time, being the chosen timepiece for men until the 20th century.</p>

<p>Women started wearing wrist watches much earlier than men, Elizabeth the 1st was given an &#8220;<a title="History of Watches: Wrist Watches" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_watches#Wristwatches" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arm watch</a>&#8221; in 1571, by the mid 19th century, most watchmakers made wristwatches, which they marketed like bracelets for women.</p>

<p>Men chose to stick with pocketwatches for quite some time, not just because of fashion, but because watches of the time had a tendancy to be damaged by exposure to the elements, so by keeping the watch sealed and in a pocket, they would last longer.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/09/6a00d83452989a69e201156f35715b970b-800wi.webp" alt="Casio Calculator Watch" title="Believe it or not, Casio still makes these!"  width="342" height="539" layout="intrinsic" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>Like many advancements, it is because of the military that men started wearing watches on their wrists.  At the end of the 19th century, the importance of synchronizing maneuvers (&#8220;Synchronize your watches!&#8221;) made constantly pulling a watch out of your pocket to be impractical, and so officers of the British Army began using wistwatches during military campaigns in the 1880s.</p>

<p>Wristwatches became even more popular during World War I.  The British War Department began issuing wristwatches to combatants in 1917.  By the end of the war, pretty much all enlisted men wore wristwatches, and after returning home, the trend caught on.  By 1930 it is said that wristwatches outnumbered pocketwatches 50 to 1.</p>

<p>By the time I got my first watch in the late &#8217;80s or early &#8217;90s, digital watches were available.  As I mentioned in the beginning of this post, I favored a Casio Calculator watch to help me be lazy with arithmetic while also telling me just how behind schedule I was.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/09/Screen-shot-2013-03-27-at-7.00.48-AM.webp" alt="Cellphones, the new pocketwatch"  title="Cell-phones, the new pocketwatch" width="384" height="360" layout="intrinsic" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>I wore a wristwatch through pretty much all of my childhood and teen years, but in early adulthood, at some point after I got my first easily pocketable cell-phone, I stopped wearing it.</p>

<p>As I mentioned I have always been a fan of function over form, and the cell phone was so much more functional than any watch, that it became my go to piece of equipment.</p>

<p>I dabbled on and off with wearing a watch in the years since going cellular, but in the end they simply weren&#8217;t useful enough to be worth taking up space on my wrist.  This became even more true when phones became &#8220;smart.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I got the first iPhone back in late 2007 it became an indispensable part of my life.  I haven&#8217;t been without a smartphone since.  But something was missing.  I have long found myself missing text message chimes, and I missed the convenience factor of being able to just glance at my wrist when I wanted to know the time.</p>

</amp-img></p>

<p>Because of this I&#8217;ve been following the wearables trend very closely for the last few years.  I was very tempted a few years ago to get the <a href="http://www.cnet.com/products/fossil-caller-id-wristwatch-w-bluetooth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fossil Caller ID Wristwatch</a> which was one of the early attempts at merging data from your phone to a watch, but the price was high and the feature set was minimal.  It just didn&#8217;t seem to be worth it.  So I waited.</p>

<p>In 2012 2 different projects grabbed my attention.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BKEQBI0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00BKEQBI0&linkCode=as2&tag=nickdotpro-20&linkId=ELSRGANHGGU27CR7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">Pebble</a> which had a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very successful kickstarter campaign</a> that showed there was very much interest in a fully functional smartwatch, and of course <a href="2013-04-16-looking-at-life-from-the-other-side-of-the-glass">Google Glass</a>.  Both of these projects sought to bring information closer to me, allowing me to interact with it faster and get back to my life.</p>

<p>I have loved exploring with Google Glass, and I still wear it most of the time.  The problem with Google Glass is that due to my high prescription and Glass&#8217; notoriously bad battery life, I can&#8217;t feasibly wear glass all of the time.</p>

<p>I unfortunately cannot get prescription frames for Glass due to the fact that the frames currently available for Glass only suit prescriptions between -4.0 and +4.0, and I have -6.75 in one eye and -7.0 in the other eye.  As such I have no choice but to wear contacts when I wear glass, and I just can&#8217;t wear contacts all of the time without it causing irritation.</p>

<p>I needed something that would give me the information that Glass gives me, and is just as convenient and accessible, but in a form factor that I can conceivably wear all of the time.  So I returned to the waiting game, waiting for a smartwatch that would fit my needs perfectly.  I read reviews with interest of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JBJ3I4Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00JBJ3I4Q&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nickdotpro-20&amp;linkId=6UWU3J3JKFP4CXGZ" class="broken_link">Samsung Galaxy Gear</a>, but it still just didn&#8217;t seem right.  It only worked properly with samsung phones, and the developer ecosystem seemed too specific, too niche.  If I was going to buy a smartwatch, it was clear to me that I needed the right platform.</p>

<p>I was definitely interested when the Android Wear announcement came and waited with deep interest for the first Android Wear devices to come out.  At Google I/O this year Google gave us all our choices of either the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LTR5HP6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00LTR5HP6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nickdotpro-20&amp;linkId=QTCKEBUUCA6TKWQI">Samsung Gear Live</a> or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LB2ZQ3C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00LB2ZQ3C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nickdotpro-20&amp;linkId=MWO7EWPFP7QKZDQQ" class="broken_link">LG G Watch</a>, and promised that when the Moto 360 came out that they would send us each one of them as well.  Since Barbara and I were both at I/O, we opted to get one of each so we could try out both the Samsung and LG Android Wear watches.</p>

<p>For the couple months following I/O before we got our 360 watches, I wore the LG, and Barbara the Samsung.  Both were great watches, but I liked the way the LG fit on my wrist better than the Samsung.  We were both (and still are) incredibly happy with Android Wear.  All the notification functionality of Glass, with easier controls.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/09/IMG_20140920_160725-e1411275704172.webp" alt="Moto 360 on my wrist" title="Yes that is a Moto 360 on my wrist, and I am happy to see it."  width="1852" height="1852" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/09/IMG_20140920_160725-e1411275704172.jpg" alt="Moto 360 on my wrist" title="Yes that is a Moto 360 on my wrist, and I am happy to see it."  width="1852" height="1852" layout="responsive" lightbox></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>Barbara and I have both switched to Moto 360 now and are very happy with it.  The round watch feels so much more natural on our wrists.  Of course now that I look at my circular watch on my wrist, I realize that <em>The Time Keeping Cycle</em> has come full circle.  I&#8217;m guessing in another 20 &#8211; 30 years we&#8217;ll once again find a reason to put time back in our pockets again.</p>

        <p>When I was young (somewhere in the early/mid &#8217;90s), I saw some program (I don&#8217;t know which) on PBS and they were talking about some guy (I can&#8217;t find the program, and don&#8217;t remember names, but I presume it was either <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/lizzy/timeline.html#1993a">Thad Starner</a> or <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/lizzy/timeline.html#1994d">Steve Mann</a>) at MIT who is wearing a computer with a Head Mounted Display and a single hand keyboard, and a computer kept in some sort of backpack.  At that point I knew 2 things.</p>

<!--more-->

<ol>
<li>Wearable Computing is a future I want to be a part of.</li>
<li>MIT was where I wanted to go to college.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now sadly I never got to attend MIT, in fact other than a little time at Tarrant County College (formerly Tarrant County Junior College) in which I didn&#8217;t even earn an associates degree, I didn&#8217;t get to go to college at all.  But I wanted to go to MIT</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/06/image1.webp" alt="A free law coalition sign at #CALICon14"  width="2048" height="1504" layout="responsive" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>This past week I&#8217;ve been attending the <a href="http://conference.cali.org/2014/" class="broken_link">24th Annual CALI Conference for Law School Computing</a> at Harvard Law School. As usual the conference was a blast and I have enjoyed checking out Harvard.</p>

<p>But what was especially exciting for me was getting a chance to visit MIT. That PBS special 20 years ago is a big part of what set me on my path towards becoming a programmer. As well as making me as fascinated as I was towards technology and the future.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/06/IMG_20140619_202224.webp" alt="Nick at MIT"  width="3264" height="2448" layout="responsive" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>As I stood in front of the main building of MIT, wearing Google Glass and posing for pictures with Tim and Mayra, it struck me that I was there. I was wearing a computer at MIT. True, I was never a student of the esteemed university, and also true that I wasn&#8217;t on a team making that wearable computer, but as a glass explorer, I have been working with the team that did over the past year, providing feedback, testing it, going to events, developing apps.</p>

<p>And as a software engineer at Justia, I work with technology every day, and I get to work on projects that make a real difference in the world, making legal information more accessible to everyone. I may not be MIT educated, but my real dream of working with the future of technology is real, and I&#8217;m living it #ThroughGlass</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

<p>Couple quick closing thoughts&#8230; First, If the man in the video I watched 2 decades ago was indeed Thad Starner, than it is extra cool because he is a <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/">Technical Lead/Manager on Google&#8217;s Project Glass</a> which means in the above picture I am literally wearing the culmination of his work from the project I was watching the video about in the first place.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/06/image2.webp" alt="This place was made for Tim"  width="2048" height="1504" layout="responsive" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>And finally. If you walk around a frosted glass with MIT on it and look at it from behind. It says &#8220;Tim.&#8221; My boss approves.</p>

        <p>Just had a very frustrating chat with Comcast Customer service.  My TiVo Premier has been on the fritz for the last several months.  Rather than buy a new one, I decided to give Comcast&#8217;s X1 a try.  So Barbara took our cable card into the Comcast service office this morning and asked for an X1.  They told Barbara that the X1 would have to be professionally installed, so they scheduled an appointment to have the X1 installed on the 10th, and gave us a regular Comcast DVR to use in the mean time.  She was told that this DVR would cost us $10/month (as opposed to the $1/month we were paying for our cable card) and that when the X1 is installed it would go up to $20/month because apparently it&#8217;s twice as good.</p>

<p>Barbara left the DVR for me to setup when I got home, which because of a GDG meetup I had tonight, wasn&#8217;t until about 9:30 pm.  After getting home I spent a good 20-30 minutes reconfiguring our entertainment system to replace the new defunct TiVo with the Comcast DVR.  Once I got everything hooked up, I went to comcast.com/activate to activate the DVR.  I didn&#8217;t even get to the point where I could enter in the serial number of the new DVR before I was given the following error message.<!--more--></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We&#8217;re sorry, we were unable to complete your activation.
  Order service returned an OPEN Service Request with ScheduleDate before TECH activation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I tried the phone activation method, and it said that they were going to have to forward me to a representative.  After waiting on hold a couple minutes I was given a recording that the office was closed and to call back between 9 am and 7pm Monday through Friday.</p>

<p>Not willing to believe that I was not going to be able to have television service tonight, I decided to try the online chat method instead to see if I could get any help.  After waiting a good 10 minutes for someone to get into the chat with me, the following chat transpired (<em>serial number and the last 4 digits of my social security number redacted for my security</em>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Hello Nicholas, Thank you for contacting Comcast Live Chat Support. My name is Bryan. Please give me one moment to review your information.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > My Issue: My wife picked up a DVR today from a service center, the automated system won&#8217;t let me activate it. Can you help me get the box activated?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Welcome to Comcast! It&#8217;s a pleasure to have you on chat. How are you doing today?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > I&#8217;m ok I guess</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > would be better if I could get television 🙂</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > That&#8217;s wonderful! I&#8217;m happy to hear that you are doing fine.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I would be more than happy to help you, Nicholas.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I understand how frustrating this might be, I apologize for the inconvenience. Rest assured I will do everything within my means to address your concern today.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > great. I tried to use the automated system to activate it, and it wouldn&#8217;t let me, it says something about service before activate.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Once we are done with the troubleshooting steps, we will decide whether a technician or swapping the box is needed to completely resolved the issue. Are we good with this?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > I think what happened is this. My wife went down to the service center and asked for the X1. They said they would have to schedule professional installation of the X1 and they scheduled it, but they gave her a regular DVR in the mean time</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Thank you for providing that information.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > May I ask what is the exact error message you are getting?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > “We&#8217;re sorry, we were unable to complete your activation. Order service returned an OPEN Service Request with ScheduleDate before TECH activation.”</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > it never even got far enough for me to put in the serial number of the box I&#8217;m trying to activate (which is &#42;<strong>&#42;</strong>&#42;**&#42;*** by the way)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Thank you for providing that information.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Let me check the code of the box on my end.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > ok</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I have found what&#8217;s causing the issue.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > The box is not activated yet on our end.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > But don&#8217;t worry I would be happy to activate it now.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > yes, I know, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to do</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I will now put codes for the box to work.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Thank you for providing that information.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > ok, thank you</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > You are most welcome.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > For security and privacy purposes of the account, may I ask for the following on the account.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Last 4 digit of SSN</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > &#42;***</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Thank you for providing that information.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I would like to set your expectation that for the DVR service to work I will need to code it as a DVR the box for the system to allow it.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > This is the authorization or activation of the service.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Adding this will cost $17.95 so you can use the full function for it.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Should I get it now?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > the person at the comcast office said $10</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Let me check it again to make sure.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Thank you for patiently waiting, Nicholas.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > no problem</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > The $10 cost is for the channels with no DVR function.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > The $17.95 will be the code for the channels with DVR function.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > May I ask which way do you want to proceed?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > we were given a DVR and told adding the DVR would add $10 and only $10 to our bill</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I&#8217;m really for the lack of information provided to you.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Sorry for the typo. Please disregard that last message.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I&#8217;m really sorry for the lack of information provided to you.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I understand how it feel.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > What I&#8217;m providing to you now is the codes I can see available on your account.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > This is very disconcerting, this is 60% more than TiVo which is a far superior device. This Comcast DVR box is stuck in the 90s, but whatever, go ahead and activate it, it&#8217;s only temporary anyway</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I&#8217;m now reviewing the account more since you went to the store the code should be added already.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > If the code was added and the issue still persist we will continue to troubleshoot.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Would it be fine with you to hold for 2-3 minutes? I&#8217;m currently having issues with the account when trying to add the code and working on a fix for it.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > sure thing</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Thank you very much!</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Thank you very much for patiently waiting, Nicholas.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > no problem</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I&#8217;m really apologize for the inconvenience. We are not able to activate it now because there is a work order on the account which is your X1 order. If activate the box the X1 order will be cancelled. This is because per account only one order can be made. What I can advise you now is to wait for the technician to come and install your X1. However there is no need for you to worry since you are not being billed right now for the services because the X1 order is not completed yet.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > That is ridiculous. The guy at the service station gave us the DVR box to use until the X1</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I really do apologize for the inconvenience and lack of information provided to you. I would greatly appreciate your understanding.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > and now you are telling me 1) I just wasted my time hooking this thing up</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > 2) that I&#8217;m going to be without a TV for a week</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > that is NOT acceptable</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I completely understand how are you feeling right now, Nicholas.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > Why would they give me a box if I can&#8217;t activate it</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > that&#8217;s stupid</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Yes, I understand. I&#8217;m really sorry for the mistake made on the local office.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > What I&#8217;m providing you right now is the correct information on the account.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > Well I&#8217;m sorry, but it&#8217;s not acceptable information.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Yes, I understand.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > I just spent an hour redoing my entertainment system</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > I expect to have TV tonight</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > if you are telling me to wait a week, you may as well cancel the whole thing and I&#8217;ll switch to another provider tomorrow</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I&#8217;m really sorry for the inconvenience. What I can do now is credit the inconvenience this has caused you.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > can you cancel the X1 and just activate the box and I&#8217;ll call them about ordering X1 later</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Yes, we can do that. All you have to do is call the hotline and cancel the appointment and add the code for the DVR to be activated.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > which I can&#8217;t do, because the hotline is closed</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Once they added the code it will start to work immediately.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I would love to do it on my end now however I will not be able to do it on my end because my tools is restricted to do that.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > What I can do now is advise you to call them tomorrow morning so they can cancel the order and activate the DVR.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > My sincerest apologies, Nicholas.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > and tonight I&#8217;m just stuck staring at a blank screen, and will probably be stuck till Saturday since I work during the day.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > What I will do is note this to the account so the next agent will be able to know what to do.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > There is no need for you to worry about he charge because you are not being billed to it yet.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > well thank you for trying, there&#8217;s no point in taking any more of your time</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I&#8217;m glad I was able to provide you all the information on what&#8217;s causing the issue and how to fix it.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > You are most welcome.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I hope you are satisfied with your experience with me here on chat. Do you have any additional question? I would be happy to assist.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > no further questions</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Thank you very much for your patience and understanding, Nicholas.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > I really appreciate your kindness.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > It was truly a pleasure to speak with you! Thank you conctacting Comcast. Feel free to contact us again through live chat (available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week). Comcast also offers great FAQ and Help forums located at www.comcast.net to help you solve many issues on your own. You can also reach us at (1-888-739-1379).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Bryan</strong> > Have a great evening, Nicholas!</p>
  
  <p><strong>Nicholas</strong> > well that&#8217;s not possible. I was so looking forward to watching some TV tonight after a long day of work, but that&#8217;s not to be. Hope you have a better evening than I do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So after all of that, no I don&#8217;t have any television service, and it doesn&#8217;t seem likely that I&#8217;m going to have television service in the foreseeable future.  All I have to say is <a href="http://google.com/fiber/newcities">Google Fiber can&#8217;t come to Sunnyvale fast enough</a>.</p>

        <p>Barbara and I are ready to attend the Rock Your Disney Side 24 hour event at Disneyland Park this Friday.  For the third year in a row, Disneyland will be open for 24 hours from 6 am Friday to 6 am on Saturday morning.  This year&#8217;s hashtag is #RockYourDisneySide and the event has a Heroes and Villains theme.  Looking forward to an exhausting but fun day.</p>

<p>We are now a month and a half after Barbara&#8217;s last chemotherapy treatment and while we still need to be careful with her out in crowds and sun, we hope this event marks the beginning of a return to normalcy for our lives.  She&#8217;s not officially marked as being &#8220;in remission&#8221; yet, but her counts have been stable for the last few months and she is no longer on the chemotherapy, so we are confident and hopeful that she will be declared in remission soon.  What better way to celebrate than a return to &#8220;The Happiest Place on Earth&#8221;</p>

        <p>As many of you know my wife <a href="http://www.barbara.pro/" title="Barbara Moline">Barbara</a> has Lupus and in October she <a href="http://www.barbara.pro/2013/11/lupus-flare-part-1-before-the-hospital/">experienced a flare up</a> of her lupus that put her into the hospital.  Before this flare up occurred however, I was already planning on doing a 5K charity walk called the Walk to End Lupus Now.  After the flare up occurred it became even more important to me to participate in the walk and raise money to help fund Lupus research and awareness.  Me and my boss Tim walked the 5K and I&#8217;m proud to say the two of us <a href="http://lupus.donorpages.com/SanFrancisco2013/moline/">raised $1600</a> for the Lupus Foundation.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This coming October I will be participating in the walk again.  If you would like to sponsor me in my walk, you can do so <a href="http://lupus2014.nick.pro">at my donor page for the event here</a>.  If you want to help even more though, I encourage you to get out there and walk with me.  You can Join Team Moline and  walk with me at the <a href="http://lupus.donorpages.com/SanFrancisco2014/">2014 San Francisco Walk to End Lupus Now</a> on Sunday October 26, 2014 in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.  If you aren&#8217;t in the bay area but want to walk to raise awareness and money for Lupus Research, the Lupus Foundation <a href="http://www.lupus.org/action/walk-to-end-lupus-now">hosts walks</a> around the country throughout the year.</p>

<p>Just last week Barbara had what is expected to be her last (6th) Chemotherapy treatment of this particular flare up and the doctor is optimistic that this particular flare up is under control.  This is a tremendous blessing to hear as her previous flare up when she was 12 required 15 Chemotherapy treatments over the course of 3 years.  The doctor is also slowly stepping down Barbara&#8217;s dosage of Prednisone (steroids).  She is now taking just 1 20 milligram pill per day.  At the height of the flare up she was taking 60 milligrams per day.</p>

<p>If you would like to know more about Lupus and how it effects people who have it, I encourage you to check out <a href="http://www.barbara.pro/2013/11/lupus-flare-part-1-before-the-hospital/">Barbara&#8217;s story on her blog</a>, and you can also read more about <a href="http://www.lupus.org/">Lupus at the Lupus Foundation of America</a> Website at <a href="http://www.lupus.org/">lupus.org</a>.</p>

    <title>Automatically post your WordPress blog to Google+ with Jetpack</title>
    <published>2013-12-12T16:11:27+00:00</published>

    <summary type="html">Automattic&#039;s Jetpack Wordpress plugin now lets you automatically post your blog posts to Google+ on publish...</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>Many people have long lamented that unlike Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Tumblr, and many other services, Google+ does not let you use an API to post.  There is an API for posting to Google+ Pages, but Google is restricting this feature to approved services.  Apparently WordPress.com is one of those services, and in the latest 2.7 version of the <a href="http://jetpack.me/" target="_blank">Jetpack plugin</a> for self-hosted WordPress blogs released yesterday, they are <a href="http://jetpack.me/2013/12/11/jetpack-2-7-publicize/">extending that service to your own self hosted WordPress blog</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>It is interesting to note that the blog post on Jetpack&#8217;s blog indicates that this feature works both for Pages <em><strong>and</strong></em> individual profiles as well, which the Google+ Platform API documentation specifically says you cannot do.</p>

<p>This helps save time and energy when posting blog posts, and also helps if you schedule your blog posts for later.  With this feature you can now schedule your blog posts to post at a specified time and rest easy knowing that it will be shared to Google+ at the same time.  This is also a great feature for multi-author blogs.  You can add multiple Google+ Profiles and Pages to the feature and have your posts post both to your individual profile as an author and to a shared page for the blog as a whole.</p>

<p>In the past, Google has specifically shied away from adding an API that will allow people to automatically post to Google+ in fear of becoming flooded with app-posted junk posts that have plagued Twitter and Facebook for years.  This is why Google has kept the list of apps that can post to Google+ limited.  It&#8217;s important to note that JetPack does not post to Google+ directly, but instead, like the rest of the services on JetPack, calls to an API on WordPress.com to have <a href="http://automattic.com/" target="_blank">Automattic&#8217;s</a> servers post for you.</p>

<p>Publicize also supports automatic posting to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Path.</p>

    <summary type="html">MoviePass has introduced changes to their service that screws over their customers, they call it a &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot;...</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>For Many months now I&#8217;ve been recommending MoviePass to everyone I talk to who likes movies. It always had several restrictions that made it hard to justify:</p>

<!--more-->

<ol>
<li>Only one movie per day</li>
<li>You can only see each movie once</li>
<li>No IMAX or 3D (you can&#8217;t even pay the upgrade cost)</li>
<li>You can&#8217;t pre-buy your movie tickets, you have to go to the theater, check in, and then buy your movies (and if you have multiple people in your party with passes, you have to each make your transaction separately, which causes longer lines at the box office)</li>
</ol>

<p>These were annoying restrictions but overall I still considered the pass to be a good enough deal to lock myself into a year contract at $34.99/month each (Me and <a href="http://www.barbara.pro/" target="_blank">Barbara</a>) and do it. It gave me the opportunity to budget my love of going to the movies to a set amount per month and not have to think about &#8220;Do I really want to pay to see this movie in theaters or should I wait for BluRay?&#8221; If I was remotely interested in a movie I went to see it, and if it turned out to suck, I didn&#8217;t care because I&#8217;ll just see another movie the next day for no additional cost.</p>

<p>Unfortunately yesterday MoviePass made a sudden change with no warning that I find absolutely unacceptable, and to make it worse they tried to pass it off as if it was some exciting new feature for their customers.  Yesterday I received an email from MoviePass with a subject line of &#8220;New Features.&#8221;  This is what MoviePass had to say</p>

<p>They are &#8220;excited to introduce a new feature&#8221;  What is this new feature that they are so excited to introduce?  A Countdown clock.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  If I go to a movie at 9:30pm on a Friday night, and then on Saturday I want to go to a matinee (which would cost them less) I can&#8217;t do it.  If the last showing of the movie I want to go to on Saturday starts at 9:25pm, I can&#8217;t do it!</p>

<p>For the most part I only have time to go to movies on the weekend, but this new feature makes it incredibly difficult to go to more than one movie per weekend as your showtimes become incredibly limited.</p>

<p>But the most insulting thing at all is that they would have the audacity to say they were &#8220;excited to introduce a new feature&#8221; as if this was something that was going to benefit their customers.  When I tried to contact them using their support email about this, I received no answer (still waiting for over 24 hours).  I then went to their live chat, where they had the audacity to say that their &#8220;research&#8221;  indicated that this wouldn&#8217;t effect 95% of their customers.</p>

<p>The only silver lining to this change is that if anyone was having trouble justifying the cost of moviepass and has been looking for a way out of their contract without paying fees to terminate early, MoviePass is giving us 14 days (Until November 13th) to cancel our subscriptions even if we are still on contract without paying their normal penalties.</p>

<p>Despite the backlash on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MoviePass">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=MoviePass&amp;src=typd">Twitter</a> about this, MoviePass has yet to make an official statement at least apologizing for the way they went about this change.  I haven&#8217;t canceled my service with them yet, because I&#8217;m waiting to see how they address the backlash.  But I assure you, if they don&#8217;t do something about this to make it right, I will be canceling my service before November 13th.</p>

    <summary type="html">It has been 1 year since my weight-loss surgery, here&#039;s how I&#039;m doing and how I celebrated....</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>1 Year ago today, I went to El Camino Hospital to <a href="2012-07-26-midnight-t-10-hours-go-time-stop-drinking-water" title="Midnight, T-10 hours to go, time to stop drinking water">have my Gastric Sleeve surgery</a>.  One year later I have lost 96 pounds since the Surgery, a total of 195 pounds since I started my weight loss journey.  It&#8217;s a shame I didn&#8217;t quite make it to 200 pounds total loss, but I&#8217;m very proud of my weight loss progress and I&#8217;m nowhere near done.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Today to celebrate my 1 year anniversary from the surgery I took a day of PTO to have a little stay-cation.  Now the old me would have used an anniversary celebration as a reason for cake, ice cream, or other treats, but this is an anniversary of weight-loss surgery.  Instead I chose to celebrate my weight loss by having an amped up day.  I started by making a high-protein low calorie hot breakfast.   Barbara and I then went down to the gym for an amped up version of my normal workout.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago I ordered a <a href="http://www.freshpair.com/Spanx-for-Men-Cotton-Compression-Crew-607.html">Spanx for men compression T-shirt</a>.  I ordered this not to make me look thinner, but because as I have lost those 195 pounds I now have a lot of loose hanging skin in my abdomen.  This skin makes vigorous cardio very difficult as with every step it flaps and smacks against the rest of my skin.  When I have tried in the last couple years to jog or run, this has become very painful very quickly and has prevented me from doing anything vigorous.  Today, wearing my Spanx I was able to get up to 6 miles per hour and maintain that for several minutes.  I did the rest of my 30 minutes on the treadmill at a still brisk 3.8 miles per hour.  I then followed up with 25 minutes of strength training doing more sets at higher weights than I&#8217;ve done in the past.  I&#8217;m very proud of what I was able to do today and I intend on spending the next several months continuing to amp up my workouts.</p>

<p>I have a goal now of getting to the point where I can run a 5K, hopefully within the next year.  My hope is to do one of <a href="http://www.rundisney.com/">RunDisney&#8217;s 5K runs</a> in 2014, and then start ramping up to bigger and better runs after that.</p>

<p>After going to a movie (where I drank water instead of anything caloric), I came home and made a delicious low calorie high-protein dream dinner to finish off the day and I&#8217;m not hungry and was quite satisfied with my meals today and my physical activity.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/07/IMG_20130726_193351.webp" alt="If you like Piña Coladas..." title="My first Piña Collada in over a year" width="2448" height="3264" layout="responsive" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>I did do one thing this evening as part of my celebration which is not best for my weight-loss.  I had a Piña Colada.  When going through the pre-op preparation I was told that I would have to stay away from Alcohol for a year.  Since that year ended yesterday I let myself have a single 6 ounce Piña Colada to celebrate.</p>

<p>I never was much of a drinker and I&#8217;m not going to become one now that I can drink again, but I will allow myself a drink here and there.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll keep you all up to date with how things keep going as I continue my weight loss journey.</p>

    <title>Warning: WordPress Brute Force Attack</title>

    <summary type="html">In light of the massive wordpress brute force attack going on, here is some advice to lock down your blog from being attacked....</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>After <a href="2012-11-12-losing-my-geek-cred-nick-pro-hacked" title="Losing my Geek Cred: Nick.pro hacked">my blog was hacked</a> a few months ago, I&#8217;ve been understandably more security conscious on my blog.  One of the things I&#8217;ve done is install a few security plugins (most notably <a title="Wordfence Security - WordPress Plugins" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordfence/" target="_blank">Wordfence Security</a>).  Wordfence is an absolutely fantastic security plugin, it monitors the files in your site to make sure that they don&#8217;t change unexpectedly, and more importantly it monitors login attempts (and other page requests on your site) for potentially harmful login attempts.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Over the past few weeks a <a title="Global WordPress Brute Force Hacks" href="http://www.wordfence.com/forums/topic/global-brute-force-hacks/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">global brute force attack</a> has been targeting wordpress installations.  I first found out about it because Wordfence started notifying me that there were more failed login attempts than usual.</p>

<p>Protect yourself and your blog with the following crucial steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t use &#8220;admin&#8221;:</strong>

<ul>
<li>If you have a user named &#8220;admin&#8221; on your wordpress installation, get rid of it!  If it is your only admin user, create a new one, log out of admin, and in as your new admin user, and then delete the user named &#8220;admin.&#8221;  The brute force attack is trying thousands of passwords with the user named admin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Use a good password:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Please don&#8217;t use &#8220;password&#8221; or &#8220;admin&#8221; or &#8220;god&#8221; or your birthday, pet&#8217;s name, or any other easily guessed password.  Use a good password.  The brute force attack is trying both a list of the top 10,000 passwords, and a dictionary random word attack.  Protect yourself, don&#8217;t use a password that is easily broken!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Use a security plugin to prevent login attempts:</strong>

<ul>
<li>As I mentioned above, I use <a title="Wordfence Security" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordfence/" target="_blank">Wordfence Security</a> by <a title="Mark Maunder" href="http://www.wordfence.com/contact/" target="_blank">Mark Maunder</a>.  This plugin is fantastic.  Not only can you set it up to lock people out if they fail to log in a certain number of times, but you can rig it where if they try a username you don&#8217;t have (like admin, because you followed step 1) it will lock them out immediately.</li>
<li>It will also notify you when it has locked someone out, and can notify you if someone successfully logs in.  This way you can have a warning if someone does manage to break through your secure password.</li>
<li>It also monitors the files on your wordpress installation and notifies you if any of the files in your themes and plugins unexpectedly changes.  This is a great plugin and I highly recommend it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>I hope this helps you secure your blog from this attack.</p>

        <p>It is hard to believe that it was just 1 year and 1 week ago, Google uploaded to its YouTube channel, a <a title="Project Glass: One day..." href="http://youtu.be/9c6W4CCU9M4" target="_blank">teaser video</a> for a project they had been working out of from their top-secret &#8220;moonshot&#8221; <a href="https://x.company/">x Labs</a> called Project Glass.</p>

<p>The project was ambitious, an augmented reality layer over your very life, answering questions before you even asked, and all around simplifying your life.</p>

<p>2 Months later at Google I/O 2012, Google staged a &#8220;<a title="Project Glass: Live Demo at Google I/O" href="http://youtu.be/D7TB8b2t3QE" target="_blank">demonstration</a>&#8221; involving a blimp, skydivers, BMX Trick bikers and more to show off the device as what seemed like little more than a network connected GoPro camera.  They then asked Developers who are interested in getting an early look at the technology if they would be willing to fork over $1,500 for the chance to be one of the first non-Google employees with this whole new class of Technology.</p>

<p>I and 2,000 other attendees happily stood in a long line to put down our commitment to try it out.  Then, months of agonizing waiting began.  Waiting for a future that was so close we could taste it.</p>

<p>Over the rest of the summer, news came slowly, but I and the rest of the Glass Explorers (that is what they call us) waited with great anticipation.  Finally in January, another video was uploaded <a title="Glass Developer Update" href="http://youtu.be/047lMUJMo8Y" target="_blank">answering the one question</a> that Developers at I/O most wanted to know, what sort of <a title="Application Programming Interface" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank">API</a>s would there be so that I and other developers could write applications for Glass.  It was called the Mirror API, and it was <a title="Representational State Transfer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">REST</a> based, which means that rather than writing software that you install on the device itself, you write web software that runs on a web server, and it communicates with the device through Google&#8217;s servers.</p>

<p>&lt;amp-youtube
    data-videoid="047lMUJMo8Y"
    layout="responsive"
    width="480"
    height="270"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p></amp-youtube></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was great news for developers, especially for web developers like myself, in that REST APIs are inherently language agnostic.  This means that I can write in any programming language, instead of a specific one for a specific device as is the case with traditional mobile development.  I was eager to get my hands dirty and start coding, and fortunately for me.  Google gave me that chance.</p>

<p>Just over a week later, on January 28th at Google&#8217;s <a title="Google San Francisco" href="https://plus.google.com/116282327849562022127/about?hl=en" target="_blank">San Francisco Office</a>, Google hosted a 2 day event they called the Glass Foundry event.  I and 200 other developers (and a week later 200 more developers at Google&#8217;s New York City office) were invited to come take what Glass Developer Advocate <a title="Timothy Jordan, Developer Advocate for the Google Glass Team" href="https://plus.google.com/+TimothyJordan/posts" target="_blank">Timothy Jordan</a> called &#8220;a Vacation with Glass.&#8221;</p>

<p>For those 2 glorious days I got to wear Google&#8217;s Project Glass, and more importantly, I got to use the Mirror API to write my first Glass Application.  Together me and my teammates <a title="Jake Weisz" href="https://plus.google.com/115181074626403443464/posts" target="_blank">Jake Weisz</a> and <a title="Nathan Buth" href="https://plus.google.com/106023745068839045104/posts" target="_blank">Nathan Buth</a> coded and hacked into the early morning hours eagerly working with Google&#8217;s latest API on a gadget that we just knew would change the way we interact with information in the future.</p>

<p>During my time wearing Glass, I was surprised just how much of the original &#8220;One Day&#8221; video was possible with it.  Things that I really did think was simply not going to be possible yet was not only possible but effortless, and it quickly began to feel like an extension of me, rather than a device I was using, in a way that no cell phone or computer ever has.</p>

<p>In just 2 days I found interacting with glass to become such second nature, that when I reluctantly <del>let them pry the device from my hands</del> returned the device they so graciously lent me, for days afterward I found myself looking up when I wanted to know simple things like the time, or the answer to a question, only to find the answer was no longer right there, ready and waiting for me.</p>

<p>The only thing about the event that I didn&#8217;t really like (though I understand it completely) is that I was not permitted to talk about anything that happened at the event, or about glass itself.  Being the talkative guy I am, this was hard for me, waiting, waiting to talk about what I believed to be the most amazing piece of equipment I&#8217;ve ever had the privilege of using.  Again, I was waiting.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while I waited, the detractors started coming out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe you’ve seen these people around San Francisco or Mountain View, inevitably staring off into space while swiping the sides of their glasses during conversation, ignoring those around them while surfing the web or scrolling through images they’ve captured with the device. I like to call them “Glassholes.” &#8212; <a title="Get Ready For Even More Google Glasshole Sightings" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/28/glassholes/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Articles like this bugged me because they inherently did not get the point.  Google Glass is not about continuing the trend of people who stare at their phones and don&#8217;t participate in the world.  Google Glass is about giving you the information you need without you looking away from what you are doing.  Google Glass is about integrating the information you need into your life.  It&#8217;s about taking someone who was looking down at their phone, and encouraging to tilt their heads up and look at the world.</p>

<p>The small floating image is purposely in your peripheral vision, not in your line of sight.  It is specifically designed to keep your attention on your surroundings.  This is why many of the videos and demonstrations Google has shown us, don&#8217;t focus on the information Glass can give you, they focus on people:</p>

<ul>
<li>doing their jobs
<amp-youtube
data-videoid="30Pjl31cyDY"
layout="responsive"
width="480"
height="270"></amp-youtube></li>
<li>spending time with their families

<amp-youtube
data-videoid="uh-liQDE3cM"
layout="responsive"
width="480"
height="270"></amp-youtube></li>
</ul>

<p>Will having Glass make me take up skydiving, or encourage me to trek to Thailand to have authentic Thai food?  Probably not, but when I&#8217;m in the moment, living my life, and there&#8217;s a question I need answering, Google Glass will be there, ready with that answer.  When that moment I&#8217;m living in, becomes that perfect moment, Google Glass will be there, ready to capture it.  No fumbling for a phone to look up an answer, taking me away, no pulling out the camera and starting it up in hopes that I can get it on in time to capture that moment.</p>

</amp-img></p>

<p>At the Glass Foundry, Timothy Jordan described it in one sentence better than I have in the last several paragraphs when he said &#8220;By bringing technology closer, we can get it out of the way.&#8221;  A statement he and others have <a title="Building New Experiences with Glass" href="http://youtu.be/JpWmGX55a40?t=35s" target="_blank">repeated</a> at other events.</p>

<p>So when will I have my Glass?  Very soon.  Last Night Google <a title="First Google Glass Devices Are Coming Off The Production Line Now, Will Ship In Batches" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/15/first-google-glass-devices-are-coming-off-the-production-line-now-will-ship-in-batches/" target="_blank">sent an email</a> to those of us joined the Explorer Program back at Google I/O 2012 saying that the first batch of Glass is off the production line, and they are ready to start getting them into the hands of the Explorers.  They don&#8217;t have enough for all of us yet, but they have some, and that&#8217;s Exciting news.</p>

<p>I know several people (many of whom I met either at Google I/O or at the Glass Foundry event) who have already got the second email, the one indicating that their specific device is ready.  And some of these friends are going to have their glass in their hands as early as today!  Unfortunately, I have not received this second email yet, which is a strong indication that I will not be in this first batch.  Hopefully the second batch will be coming real soon, and I&#8217;ll get the opportunity to get my Glass very soon.</p>

<p>Also last night (they&#8217;ve been busy), the Glass Developer team released the <a title="Mirror API Docs" href="https://developers.google.com/glass/" target="_blank">developer documentation</a> for the Mirror API so that other developers can start dreaming of their own applications and start working on them.</p>

<p>The future of technology looks great, and my future looks great, on the other side of the Glass.</p>

        <p>As many of my friends know, I am a huge Disney Fan.  A year and a half ago, on a trip to Disneyland with my wife and Brother-in-law I went through the line queue at <a title="Space Mountain - Tomorrowland - Disneyland" href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/space-mountain/" target="_blank">Space Mountain</a> and attempted to get into the ride vehicle.  Sadly, I couldn&#8217;t even sit down, let alone pull down the lap bar, and I was forced to get off the ride and wait while they enjoyed it without me.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Later that trip in July of 2011, at Disney California Adventure, I attempted to ride California Screamin&#8217; only to once again sadly have to wait while they enjoyed themselves without me.</p>

<p>As those of you who follow my blog know, I&#8217;ve lost a lot of weight since that trip.  On Tuesday, December 11th, I went in for my monthly weigh in and I was <strong>339.6 pounds</strong>.  This is a total of <strong>150.6</strong> <strong>pounds lost!</strong></p>

<p>Friday, December 14th, 2012 My wife and I went to Disneyland again, and the first thing I did that Friday morning is make a bee-line for Space Mountain.  I&#8217;m happy to report that the weight loss was enough, I was successfully able to ride Space Mountain, and the proof is above.</p>

<p>The next day, December 15th, 2012, we had a great time at Disney California Adventure, and like before I made it my goal to ride California Screamin&#8217;.  I&#8217;m happy to report that once again I was successful and I was able to ride it as well.</p>

<p>Both rides were fantastic (in fact Space Mountain seemed even better than I remember from my childhood) and were a great encouragement to me that my weight-loss efforts are working.</p>

        <p>If you attempted to visit my blog on Friday using either Firefox or Chrome, you most likely received a warning that the site was compromised and dangerous.  While I&#8217;m still not sure how they got through, I can tell you that my blog was compromised.  Code was injected into the site in every place where javascript was being output that attempted to install malware on the computers of people who visited nick.pro.</p>

<p>No it was not because I was lazy and didn&#8217;t keep my blog up to date because I did.  The blog was already running the most up to date version of wordpress available.  The compromise most likely came through a vulnerability in one of the plugins or in the theme I was using.</p>

<p>My first inclination would be to pretend that such an embarrassing lapse of security never happened, but I thought that perhaps the tale of how I&#8217;ve brought things back up might help others who find their websites hacked as well.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The infection first came up on Wednesday night and was pointed out to me by a coworker.  I spent a few hours cleaning out all the injected javascript and doing what I thought would lock down the site from being infected again.  Unfortunately Thursday night at just before midnight, the infection recurred.  Rather than spend hours trying to clean it out again, I took the entire site down, and left up a simple &#8220;offline&#8221; message with a 503 status code to indicate that it was a temporary outage (as suggested under Quarantine your Site on google&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=163634" target="_blank">Cleaning your site</a>&#8221; help page).</p>

<p>Friday night I did a fresh install of the wordpress software with a new database, new database password, and new password for my user.  I then imported my content from a backup copy from well before the hack (you do make regular backups of your blog&#8217;s content right?) and manually copied over the images (and only the images) from a backup as well.</p>

<p>Because I am still unsure how the attacker gained access to my site, I installed only the bare minimum plugins to get my site functioning again, and for the moment am using the default <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentyeleven" target="_blank">TwentyEleven</a> WordPress theme that comes with a stock wordpress installation.  When I have more time I will make a brand new theme not using any existing theme as a basis in case it was the theme I was using that was compromised.</p>

<p>I held off writing this &#8220;I&#8217;m back&#8221; post for the weekend in case somehow I still didn&#8217;t have the leak secured, but the site has not been compromised again, so hopefully the worst is behind me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p><a title="Newsies: The Musical on Broadway" href="http://www.newsiesthemusical.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">_Newsies_</a> is a relatively new (hit Broadway in March, 2012) Broadway Play by Disney based on the <a title="Newsies (1992) on IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104990/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1992 live-action Disney movie musical of the same name</a>, which in turn was based on the historical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsboys_Strike_of_1899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsboys Strike of 1899</a>. It is currently playing at the <a href="http://www.nederlandertheatre.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nederlander Theatre</a> on 42nd Street in the Broadway theatre district of Manhattan.</p>

<p>The play was everything I hoped it would be. Barbara and I really enjoyed it, and given the chance I would definitely see it again. If you visit (or live in New York) and get a chance to see it, I highly recommend the play to everyone, especially those who enjoyed the original movie, as it is every bit as good as the original (better even in many ways).</p>

<!--more-->

<hr />

<p>The story centers on fictional strike leader Jack Kelly, a newsie in his late teens who, along with his fellow Newsies, rebel against a price hike imposed on them by newspaper tycoons Joseph Pulitzer and William-Randolph Hearst (Random note: Barbara, Mike and I <a href="2007-01-03-2006-a-nick-oddity" title="2006 – A Nick Oddity">visited Hearst Castle</a>, the Massive home of William-Randolph Hearst in 2006).</p>

<p>Jack is a budding artist who aspires to leave New York saying &#8220;You keep your small life in a big city, give me a big life, in a small town.&#8221; at the intro to the prologue song <em>Santa Fe</em>.</p>

<p>As the Newsboys get ready and started with their morning routes (<em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/6coRHZEuwsT61bQM6NsjqV">Carrying the Banner</a></em>), Pulitzer schemes with his staff on how to get more circulation in a time when headlines aren&#8217;t the greatest. They decide that if they raise the wholesale cost to the newsies from 50 cents per hundred papers, to 60 cents per hundred, newsies would have to sell 10 more papers in order to make the same amount of money (<em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/1rNZdFZDDqs4bHmSWV2mj7">The Bottom Line</a></em>).</p>

<p>While hiding from the warden of a local juvenile hall called &#8220;The Refuge,&#8221; in a Vaudville theatre with his new friends Davey and Les (<em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/5ZBuajcA9helXKf0kijwIs">Thats Rich</a></em>), Jack meets a young female reporter named Katherine (<em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/6zeHbZnkUcqTAwn2Qhkgjf">I Never Planned on You</a></em>) who grabs his attention.</p>

<p>After learning about the price hike, Jack and (reluctantly) Davey decide to organize the Newsies in a strike against &#8220;Mighty Bill and Joe&#8221; (<em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/6xL1QzHm00nlEWM5IcGZen">The World Will Know</a></em>). Katherine overhears about the strike and figures this story might be her chance at a big break to become a full reporter instead of just a Vaudville reviewer. She sets out to write about the plight of the Newsies (<em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/0qlWOVWmcWSP5oSwC0aaAT">Watch What Happens</a></em>).</p>

<p>When their first attempts at raising support from other groups of Newsies of New York fails, the rag-tag band of misfits feels dejected. It falls on Davey to bolster their spirits with an inspirational Dance number (<em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/4yDnyrrcU8E89p7cdAMaGy">Seize the Day</a></em>). This particular number is the climax of act one, and includes some impressive acrobatics and choreography that uses the papers themselves.</p>

<p>At one point in the song, the newsies crumple up sheets of newspaper and throw them out into the audience. Being so close, Barbara and I were actually able to catch 2 sheets of the paper, and I was impressed in that they do actually appear to be pages from a Thursday, July 20, 1989 issue of The New York World.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in the chaos from the riot that was inspired by Seize the Day, Snider, the Warden of the Refuge captures and beats the crippled Newsie &#8220;Crutchy&#8221; and carts him off to the Refuge. Jack, who blames himself for Crutchy getting hurt, decides to run off and forget about the strike (<em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/19OKUCz1dVheTSNFok96yb">Santa Fe (Reprise)</a></em>). Meanwhile the rest of the Newsies (and Katherine) celebrate with a tap dancing number because they have become famous as Katherine&#8217;s article has made the front page of <em>The New York Sun</em> (<em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/6d0ZUFGujfWikLTpKghuIU">King of New York</a></em>).</p>

    height="270"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p></amp-youtube></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point it is Jack who needs some inspiration in order to stay with the cause and continue to fight for the plight of the Newsies. (<em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/7C8PCkgSZHpPdva7J1q4xF">Watch What Happens (Reprise)</a></em>). And upon getting the inspiration he needs, agrees to speak at a Rally to increase the membership in their Newsboys Union. He also decides to visit Pulitzer and issue the demands of the Newsies, as well as invite Pulitzer to speak at the Rally. While in Pulitzer&#8217;s office however, he is demoralized by the tycoon who heavily threatens to harm Jack, and more importantly Davey&#8217;s family, if Jack doesn&#8217;t agree to speak against the strike at the Rally (<em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/5MzD10eAeRgj4hyAkyclyK">The Bottom Line (Reprise)</a></em>). Even more demoralizing to Jack, Pulitzer reveals that Katherine is actually Katherine Pulitzer (his daughter), which leaves Jack feeling like he has been played as a sucker.</p>

<p>All the Newspaper Boys of New York (including the much Lauded Brooklyn led by Spot Conlon) assemble in the Vaudeville theatre for the Rally (<em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/23ODXfCCZTL2rbZ6q2uToo">Brooklyn&#8217;s Here</a></em>) but Jack, who doesn&#8217;t want Davey and his family to be harmed, and is demoralized to find out that the woman he has fallen for is the daughter of his enemy, speaks for the dissolving of the Union and ending of the strike.</p>

<p>Katherine visits Jack on his rooftop home and convinces him that she does truly care for him (<em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/0MvHuL4IOGZ1SD1uYzYvNU">Something to Believe in</a></em>), and pitches an idea of a way to actually win against her father. Her idea is to spread the strike further, not just among the Newsies, but all of the working kids of New York.</p>

<p>They decide to publish a paper of their own and use it to organize an even bigger Rally. They break into <em>The World</em> and publish their paper on an old cast aside printing press stored in the cellar, and the Newsies distribute <em>The Newsies Banner</em> to every working kid in New York (<em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/5DTvdWPSGVxmJMwsFM9zPf">Once and For All</a></em>).</p>

<p>With a visit from Governor Teddy Roosevelt, and all the bad publicity of the strike, Pulitzer finally discusses a &#8220;A compromise we can all live with&#8221; with Jack. He will split the difference on the price hike (bringing it down to 55 cents per hundred) but will also agree to buy back any papers the Newsies can&#8217;t sell. Roosevelt shuts down the Refuge and imprisons Warden Snider for his horrid running of the establishment after seeing an illustration by Jack on the conditions that were there, and Pulitzer offers Jack a job as a Political Cartoonist after seeing how influential the drawing was.</p>

<p>Jack decides to start a new dream and stay in New York with his friends and the woman he loves instead of pursuing his dream of moving to New Mexico (<em><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/6OHgYFIAbsMsnp44QoHC84">Finale</a></em>).</p>

<p>I first heard about <a title="Newsies: The Musical on Broadway" href="http://www.newsiesthemusical.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">_Newsies_</a> back on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nickmoline/posts/10150793457108336" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 4, 2012</a> and have been very much hoping to see it ever since.</p>

<p>See when I was a kid, the 1992 movie was one of my favorites.  Somewhere (I&#8217;ll have to find them, they aren&#8217;t digital) I have some pictures of me dressed up as a Newsie at age 13 and handing out vintage newspapers at an event in Leesburg, VA.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been adamantly following the progress of the play leading up to getting to see it.  I happily tweeted when the soundtrack came out.</p>

        <p>This morning at 10 am Pacific time marked 48 hours till I go under the knife.  That means it is officially time to switch to clear liquids only.  On the bright side, no more protein shakes until a few days after surgery.  On the not so bright side, I&#8217;m now severely limiting my caloric intake even more.</p>

<p>I had my monthly normal weigh in this afternoon and was down only slightly from my pre-op appointment with my surgeon from a couple weeks ago.  I&#8217;m now down to <strong>404.0 lbs</strong> which brings my total weight loss down to <strong>86.2 pounds</strong>.</p>

<p>For those of my friends and family who believe in the power of prayer, please pray for me as I go through this final diet step before surgery, and on Thursday at 10 am Pacific time, when the operation will begin.</p>

<p><em>Note for those confused why losing 2.7 more pounds only brings me to 86.2 pounds when I had <a href="2012-07-10-pre-op-appointment-day-down-86-pounds" title="Pre-Op Appointment Day, Down over 83 pounds!">previously stated</a> I had lost 86.1 pounds. I apparently was mistaken <a href="2012-06-01-weight-loss-update-and-transparency" title="Weight Loss Update and transparency">when I wrote that my initial weigh in number was 492.8 pounds</a> back in January, 2011.  My initial weigh in was actually 490.2 pounds.  I have adjusted the numbers from my previous 2 posts accordingly to indicate that at my previous post the number should have been 83.5 pounds.</em></p>

<p>Fortunately a good friend and coworker has brought me some home made chicken stock that while still just being liquid broth, is a great respit for me once a day from the monotony of protein shakes.  Thank you.</p>

<p>Next thursday I will go under, and when I come out I&#8217;ll have a tiny stomach that should make dieting easier, hopefully.</p>

        <p>Today was my pre-op appointment with the surgeon to make sure I&#8217;m all set for surgery.  When I stepped on the scale (which looked just like the one pictured on the right) today I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I&#8217;m down to <strong>406.7</strong>.  This means I&#8217;ve lost <strong>83.5</strong> pounds total so far and I haven&#8217;t even had the surgery yet.</p>

<p>Surgery is scheduled for Thursday, July 26, 2012.</p>

<p>I attribute the accelerated weight loss to the liquid only diet the surgeon has me on leading up to the surgery date.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p><strong>UPDATE 2012-06-18: </strong>My Justia colleague, <a title="Dan Vu Quoc" href="http://www.vuquoc.com/" target="_blank">Dan Vu Quoc</a>, has let me know that the 3rd party shareware Screen Resolution utility for Mac <a href="http://www.madrau.com/download/latest/latest.html" target="_blank">SwitchResX</a> is capable of pushing the Macbook Pro with Retina Display&#8217;s resolution up to the full 2880 by 1600 resolution even when not plugged in to an external monitor.  I have tried this out myself, and can confirm it is true!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I&#8217;ve used a 28&#8243; monitor plugged into a 17&#8243; Macbook Pro for a long time now, and it&#8217;s great to have all that screen real estate when coding for putting my editor window side by side with a browser window for testing, or a terminal window for running server side commands.  I would get so used to having such a high resolution display that when I would unplug to go into a meeting (or take a flight) going down to the 1920 x 1200 resolution that the 17&#8243; Macbook supported (max) was hard for me, there just wasn&#8217;t enough screen real estate to get work done effectively.  Add to that just how heavy the 17&#8243; Macbook Pro was and the fact that I am <a href="2012-06-01-weight-loss-update-and-transparency" title="Weight Loss Update and transparency">so fat</a> that I can&#8217;t actually use the laptop on my lap on the plane, and it was just darn near unusable.</p>

<p>Because of this, I was understandably excited at the announcement of the new Macbook Pro with Retina Display which according to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/" target="_blank">tech specs</a> supports an astounding 2880 by 1800 resolution, higher resolution than even the 2560 x 1440 resolution of the 28&#8243; Display I use at work.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as many others have <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-33620_3-57454551-278/forget-retina-look-how-much-the-new-macbook-pro-displays/" target="_blank">pointed out</a>, you can&#8217;t actually set your Macbook Pro to the full 2880 x 1800 resolution.  The screen does support 2880 x 1800 resolution, but Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Retina Display&#8221; technique is to use the extra pixels to make things sharper, not to display more on the screen.</p>

<p><amp-img  title="Maximum Resolution on Retina Display is 1920 x 1600" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/06/Region-capture-1.webp" alt="Maximum Resolution on Retina Display is 1920 x 1600" data-recalc-dims="1" width="681" height="422" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback title="Maximum Resolution on Retina Display is 1920 x 1600" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/06/Region-capture-1.png" alt="Maximum Resolution on Retina Display is 1920 x 1600" data-recalc-dims="1" width="681" height="422" layout="responsive" lightbox></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>The maximum resolution you can set the display to happens to be 1920 x 1200, which happens to be the same resolution of the older 17&#8243; model (at least it is on a much ligher 15&#8243; model, but it still doesn&#8217;t give me any more screen real-estate).</p>

<p>The thinner size, lighter weight and much higher specs overall were enough to prompt the upgrade however and I am writing this post from a brand new 15&#8243; Macbook Pro with Retina Display and whopping 16 Gigs of RAM.</p>

<p>I also happen to be staring at the laptop screen set at 2550 x 1600 resolution and lots of beautiful side by side windows that I would normally not be able to have next to each other on a laptop screen.</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; you may ask.  &#8220;Haven&#8217;t the others said it is impossible?&#8221;  Indeed they have, but it is possible, it&#8217;s just not very useful, yet.</p>

<p><amp-img  title="Look at that high-resolution laptop screen" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/06/100_0150-e1339900862458.webp" alt="Look at that high-resolution laptop screen" data-recalc-dims="1" width="3064" height="2949" layout="responsive" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback title="Look at that high-resolution laptop screen" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/06/100_0150-e1339900862458.jpg" alt="Look at that high-resolution laptop screen" data-recalc-dims="1" width="3064" height="2949" layout="responsive" lightbox></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>It turns out that since the monitor is capable of displaying up to 2880 x 1800 resolution, that when you put the display options in mirrored mode (where the laptop screen shows the same thing as the monitor you are plugged into), it will happily scale the laptop screen up to the full resolution of the monitor you are plugged into.  In this case, an older Apple Cinema HD 30&#8243; monitor with a resolution of 2550 x 1600 resolution.</p>

<p>Mirrored mode has of course been around for a long time, but previously when you would put the laptop in mirrored mode when connected to a high resolution external monitor, it would scale the external monitor down to the maximum resolution of the laptop (making the external monitor look like crap).</p>

<p>Now, as I said, it&#8217;s not very useful yet, because if I&#8217;m plugged into a 30&#8243; monitor anyway, I may as well just use the 30&#8243; monitor.  What I want is to be able to display this resolution when I&#8217;m not plugged in, and naturally the moment I unplug the 30&#8243; monitor, the laptop screen goes right back to the lower resolution.</p>

<p>Why Apple doesn&#8217;t give me the option to use 2550 x 1600 resolution (or the full 2880 x 1800) when the screen is obviously fully capable of displaying it, is anyone&#8217;s guess, but it is another example of Apple believing that they know best when it comes to customizing and configuring your apple product.  Hopefully someone will soon release a hack that will enable the higher resolutions for normal use.</p>

<p>As for how the screen looks at 2550 x 1600 resolution, it actually looks pretty darned good, text is still fairly crisp (though noticeably not &#8220;retina&#8221; crisp and obviously extremely small).  If I could manage to get the laptop up to this resolution under normal circumstances, I probably would go ahead and do it for the extra screen real estate when operating without a monitor.  For the time being though, I will just have to be satisfied with 1920 by 1200 like everybody else.</p>

        <p>As everyone who has ever seen me (or a picture of me) can attest, I am extremely obese.  After I wrote <a href="2011-08-27-pottermore-cheats-earning-more-house-points-through-failure-then-success-in-potion-making" title="Pottermore Cheats: Earning more house points through failure then success in potion making">my most popular blog post ever</a>, one wiki (which doesn&#8217;t seem to be online anymore) linked to my article and credited me only as &#8220;a very large man&#8221; and it is true, I was and still am quite huge.</p>

<p>What those closer to me know, is I have since January 2011 been working on this problem.  I started working on losing some of that excess weight and have made some great progress.  As of just last week I&#8217;ve reached an important milestone in this progress and I wanted to finally come clean and share the real numbers with the world.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>On Tuesday, January 4, 2011 I went to my first monthly scheduled weigh-in with nutritionist <a title="Karen Handy" href="http://www.pamf.org/providersearch/?sitecfg=41&vs=detail&action=providerdetail&masterid=21347" target="_blank">Karen Handy</a> at the <a href="http://www.ahealthyweight.org/" target="_blank">Mountain View HMR Office</a> of the <a href="http://www.pamf.org/" target="_blank">Palo Alto Medical Foundation</a>.  At that weigh in, I weighed <strong>490.2lbs</strong>, frighteningly close to 500 pounds.</p>

<p>I started working on it hard, changing my diet, tracking calories, joining a gym class and working out, and it started working.  By my May weigh in, I was down to <strong>453.2lbs</strong>, almost 40 pounds of weight loss in 4 months time.  I was pretty proud of my progress and vowed to work even harder to keep losing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my progress stalled out at that point.  At my June weigh in, I actually gained a few pounds and was up to <strong>457.0lbs</strong>.  I kept working and working at it, but for some reason I was at my first real plateau.  In July I had gone down again slightly, to <strong>455.0lbs</strong> but the rapid weight loss seemed to be at an end.  It was time for phase 2.</p>

<p>I scheduled a consultation with a Bariatric Surgeon (<a href="http://gastricbypasssanfrancisco.com/john-feng-md-bariatric-surgeon-gastric-bypass-san-francisco.htm" target="_blank">Doctor John Feng</a>) about having the <a href="http://gastricbypasssanfrancisco.com/realize-gastric-band-doctors-bay-area-san-francisco-ca.htm" target="_blank">Gastric Sleeve Surgery</a> on July 27, 2011. See while I was doing everything I could to eat healthier foods and exercise more, I was having serious problems with hunger.  I would eat what I was supposed to, but it was just not filling me up, so I would eat more (still healthy) food.  But too much of a good thing is not a good thing.</p>

<p>There are basically 3 main types of Gastric surgery done commonly today (there are others, but these 3 are the most common and safest).  Gastric Bypass, Gastric Sleeve, and Gastric Band.  Bypass is the one credited with the most weight loss, but also has the biggest impact on your life and has many dangers related to it (as it reroutes part of your small intestine to decrease absorption of nutrients in foods, many people end up severely malnourished after getting Bypass).  Band is the most reversible (you put a small tube around the top of the stomach and insert saline solution into it to squeeze the stomach, tricking the body into thinking the stomach is smaller and killing your hunger) but has the least amount of weight loss success.</p>

<p><amp-img  title="Diagram Gastric Sleeve" alt="Diagram Gastric Sleeve" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/06/DiagramGastricSleeve.webp" width="349" height="324" layout="intrinsic" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback title="Diagram Gastric Sleeve" alt="Diagram Gastric Sleeve" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/06/DiagramGastricSleeve.jpg" width="349" height="324" layout="intrinsic" lightbox></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>I&#8217;m going for the middle ground, Gastric Sleeve.  With Gastric Sleeve, they cut out a large portion of my stomach leaving a small cylindrical stomach.  Most surgeons will make it about the size of a banana (my mother&#8217;s did that for her).  My surgeon is a little more agressive and says it will be about the size of a Magic Marker.  With a stomach so small, naturally I will feel full with far less food (they say I will basically be able to &#8220;stomach&#8221; about 2-3 ounces of food per meal).  This, along with continuing my healthier diet and exercise will help me to return to the rapid progress I had in the beginning.</p>

<p>There was just one wrinkle.  The surgeon wanted me to lose some more weight before he would give me the surgery.  Specifically he wanted me to lose an additional 25 pounds before he would be willing to operate on me.  As I was 455lbs at that visit, that set my goal weight (for the next phase) at <strong>430lbs</strong>.</p>

<p>The weight loss continued (more or less) but at a much slower pace than the beginning.  To make matters worse, in September I had a health complication that in October put me in the hospital for a week.  I developed a bad (and particularly persistant) case of cellulitis in my left leg which dampened my cardio routine for a couple months.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t get close to the goal until my December 2011 weigh in when I was <strong>433.3lbs</strong> (within striking distance and oh so close).  It was also around that time that I finished all of the other checkpoints for having the surgery (blood tests, heart tests, shooting me with x-rays while I sucked down barium, and a psych eval).  I was getting excited, it was finally going to happen.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I guess Christmas hurt me a bit more than expected.  In my January weigh in I had gained nearly 10 pounds and was up to an ugly <strong>441lbs</strong>.  In the few months that followed I really struggled to try and lose those last 11 pounds.</p>

<p>Last week, on <strong>May 23, 2012</strong>, I had my latest weigh in and I was <strong>428.0lbs</strong> a full 2 pounds under the mark for the first time.</p>

<p>In the last week things are on track once again and appointments have been scheduled.</p>

<p>My pre-op appointment is scheduled for <strong>June 12, 2012</strong> and my post-op appointment for <strong>August 14, 2012</strong>.  I don&#8217;t yet have the actual date of the surgery, but it will be in there somewhere.  I personally am hoping for on or around <strong>July 16, 2012</strong> for the date of the surgery.</p>

<p>I will keep my blog, as well as my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nickmoline" target="_blank">facebook</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/100038801356570551641" target="_blank">google+ profiles</a> updated with my progress as I continue losing this weight and moving towards &#8220;a new Nick&#8221; as someone just called my future self.</p>

    <summary type="html">Web Intents in Google Chrome 19+ changed what happens when you view an Atom or RSS Link, here&#039;s how to get your XML Back...</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>Since the very beginning, when met with an Atom or RSS feed, Google Chrome responds by rendering the XML as unformatted xml (unless your feed happens to have an XSL stylesheet like feedburner adds).  One of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=84" target="_blank">earliest bugs reported</a> to Google is that this should not be, that it would instead be more friendly to invite the user to subscribe to the feed in a feed reader (like Firefox does) or render the feed yourself (like Safari does).</p>

<p>In the recently released stable Chrome 19, one of the new features is that instead of displaying the XML as unformatted xml, it fires off a <a href="http://webintents.org/view" target="_blank" class="broken_link">view web intent</a> instead.  This may be a good first step towards making feeds friendlier to use.  Instead of seeing a page the average reader doesn&#8217;t understand, they could be shown their own apps that they&#8217;ve installed.</p>

<p><!--more-->
<amp-img  src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/05/Region-capture-5.webp" alt="No Feed Reader Apps" title="No Feed Reader Apps" width="509" height="269" layout="intrinsic" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/05/Region-capture-5.png" alt="No Feed Reader Apps" title="No Feed Reader Apps" width="509" height="269" layout="intrinsic" lightbox></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>Unfortunately the default does not suggest any feed reader apps, and clicking on the link to search the chrome web store for an app gives you an unfortunately inconvenient &#8220;No Results Found.&#8221;  Google really should have anticipated the release of their own new browser with a full web app for Google Reader with support for web intents, but it appears they didn&#8217;t.  In fact, there still does not appear to be an official google reader web app for chrome.</p>

<p>Even more annoying for me, is there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any way to just view the XML in chrome like I used to.  As a developer I&#8217;m often working on feeds for various projects.  When I&#8217;m testing these feeds, I need to be able to see the XML and the new web intents support drives me nuts.  So nuts in fact that I started looking for information on developing a webintents enabled web app just so that I could create my own app that shows me the XML.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I&#8217;m not the only person who finds this annoying, and even more fortunately, someone has already saved me the trouble of writing my own web intents app just so that I can see the XML.  A Developer named <a href="https://plus.google.com/111567061469336027617/" target="_blank">Mihai Parparita</a> has <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oceapojkdgeophkjdijkpbjifdnfimdh" target="_blank">created a chrome app</a> that does exactly that!  For more details, check out <a href="http://blog.persistent.info/2012/05/feed-web-intent-viewer.html" target="_blank">his blog post</a> on the matter.</p>

        <p>Remember when GMail <a title="GMail on April 1, 2004" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040401041817/http://gmail.google.com/" target="_blank">first came out</a>?  1GB of email was unheard of, especially in a free service at the time.  One of Google&#8217;s big selling points was &#8220;<em>you&#8217;ll never need to delete another message.</em>&#8221;  It was right there on the home page.  If you compare the home pages from 2004 and today for Gmail you&#8217;ll note they still refer to it as being &#8220;Lots of space&#8221; but they no longer say you&#8217;ll never need to delete another message.  The message about never deleting email disappeared sometime between <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090302230336/https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=mail&passive=true&rm=false&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2F%3Fui%3Dhtml%26zy%3Dl&bsv=zpwhtygjntrz&ss=1&scc=1&ltmpl=default&ltmplcache=2" target="_blank">March, 2009</a> and December 2009.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Why did the message go away?  Because the users proved that 1GB (then 2GB, then 4GB, then 7GB) simply wasn&#8217;t enough to store EVERY email.  To combat this, back in 2007, Google released a means of <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/simple-way-to-get-more-storage.html" target="_blank">purchasing more storage space</a> at a rate of 6GB for $20/year, this storage would be shared amongst your Google Docs, GMail, and Picasa accounts.  Over time these prices got even better.  Yesterday you could buy 20GB of storage for <strong>$5 a year</strong>.</p>

<p><amp-img title="Announcing Google Drive" src="Announcing Google Drive" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/04/gdrive-is-here.webp" width="500" height="280" layout="intrinsic" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback title="Announcing Google Drive" src="Announcing Google Drive" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/04/gdrive-is-here.png" width="500" height="280" layout="intrinsic" lightbox></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>Today however, with the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/04/introducing-google-drive-yes-really.html" target="_blank">Google Drive release</a>, the <a href="http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=39567&p=butter_old_storage" target="_blank">prices have changed</a> from being yearly, to being monthly, while yesterday you could get 20GB for $5 a year, today the cheapest plan is 25GB for <strong>$2.49 a</strong> <strong>month</strong> (which comes out to $29.88/year).  This is a very significant increase, but it&#8217;s not what I find the most annoying:  GMail storage space is now completely separate than Google Drive (formerly Google Docs) and Picasa storage.  The 25GB you are purchasing is only for Google Drive and Picasa, not for GMail.</p>

<p>They soften the blow by ALSO giving you an upgrade to 25GB on GMail, but this is separate from the 25GB on Google Drive.  Now this means that you are really buying about 35GB for the $29.88 a year (but you could previously buy 80GB for $20 a year so it&#8217;s still a sizeable increase), but the kicker is, the 25GB of space on GMail is fixed.  If you buy 25GB of space on Google Drive, you get 25GB of space on GMail, if you buy 1TB of space on Google Drive, you get 25GB of space on GMail.</p>

<p>There is no longer any option available to purchase more than 25GB of space on GMail whatsoever, no matter how much you may want it so that you <em>never have to delete another email</em></p>

<p><amp-img title="Never delete another email" alt="Never delete another email" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/04/Region-capture-29.webp" width="497" height="46" layout="intrinsic" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to say I have hope that they will allow this option soon, but I don&#8217;t really.  The premium Google Apps for Business has long given 25GB of space for GMail, and even though I have personally wanted to buy more space, Google has never given me the option to buy more on a Google Apps account.  It seems the dream of limitless email storage is no longer alive.</p>

    <summary type="html">A Coding Challenge to get into Google I/O 2012 went awry when Google&#039;s developers made a simple validation mistake...</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>This morning Google <a href="http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2012/04/code-jams-sprint-to-google-io.html" target="_blank">opened up a programming competition</a> using the same system as Google Code Jam (they called it the Google Code Jam Sprint to I/O) to win the right to buy 1 of 100 tickets to Google I/O.  Normal Registration for the conference closed <a href="2012-03-27-google-io-sells-out-in-less-than-a-half-hour" title="Google I/O 2012 Sells out in less than a half hour">20 minutes after it opened</a> back on March 27th due to the incredible demand, so naturally those developers who couldn&#8217;t get in before were excited and ready to battle for the chance to buy a ticket.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The competition consisted of 2 problems, programmers could write their code in any language (as long as the compiler is free to use).  It would work like this, you would write a program according to their specifications of the problem, and then you would submit it.  When you submit it, google would provide you with a file of sample input data and then give you 1 minute to run your code against that sample data and then submit the output to them.  They would then run a validator across the output and tell you if you were correct or not.  If you were correct, it would accept your answer, if not, it would reject it.</p>

<p>The first question went like this (paraphrasing)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Google Store has <code>M</code> new designs of android mini-statues available, and they have <code>L</code> of each design in stock.  You, an avid collector and generous gifter, want to buy a certain number of each of these new designs (K<sub>1</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>&#8230; K<sub>M</sub>). The problem is&#8230; the packages for these statues are all exactly the same, and don&#8217;t indicate what is inside, and you cannot open the package before purchasing.  What is the minimum number of packages you need to purchase to guarantee you have all of the statues you want in a worst-case scenario</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sample data was a list of lines in the following format for different test cases:<br />
L M K<sub>1</sub> K<sub>2</sub> <em>...</em> K<sub><em>M</em></sub></p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>5 3 4 2 1
5 3 5 5 5
5 2 1 5
6 4 0 0 0 0
2 4 5 1 2 3
0 3 4 1 2
9 5 1 1 1 1 1
</code></pre>

<p>Taking the first one (They have 5 each of 3 different designs, and you want 4 of the first, 2 of the second, and 1 of the third), the correct answer would be 14 (in order to guarantee you have at least 4 of the first, at least 2 of the second, and at least 1 of the third, you would have to buy enough that you would have ALL of all but 1 of them, and then the highest K for the remainder)</p>

<p><amp-mathml layout="container" data-formula="\[ B = (L * (M-1)) + max(K) \]"></amp-mathml></p>

<p>The question also said that if it was impossible to get what you want, you should return -1 (like the 5th and 6th examples, you can&#8217;t buy more statues than they had available in the first place)</p>

<p>Now most programmers seeing something like the 4th test case there (<code>6 4 0 0 0 0</code>) would realize that if you don&#8217;t want to buy any of them, than the answer is 0 (minimum number to buy in order to get 0 statues is 0), so the basic pseudo code to solve this problem is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">function process_test_case($L = 0, $M = 0, $K = []) {
     if (max($K) == 0) 
        return 0;
     elseif (max($K) &gt; $L) 
        return -1;
     else 
        return ($L * ($M - 1)) + max($K);
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is just one problem&#8230; Google&#8217;s developers that came up with this test, didn&#8217;t think about the possibility where you don&#8217;t want any statues (<code>max($K) == 0</code>), so if you ran the above code and returned 0 on the sample 4, google&#8217;s validator would come across with &#8220;Incorrect&#8221;, on the other hand if you left that line out and only did the other 2 possibilities, it would say you were &#8220;correct&#8221;</p>

<p>Naturally a lot of the programmers who entered the competition were quite upset about this, and complained to Google <a href="https://plus.google.com/111395306401981598462/posts/LmdU3TvNVrs" target="_blank">via comments on the Google+ post</a> that announced the competition.  Eventually google put up the following message saying that they realize they made a mistake:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We&#8217;ve made a mistake in problem A. The correct output is 0, but it is being judged as wrong because 4 of our problem writers have independently made the same bug in their solutions. We would like to apologize for the confusion this has caused. We will send an email to all participants shortly, announcing our plan to resolve this issue in the least unfair manner possible. We take a lot of precautions to prevent mistakes like this, but we have messed up this time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I did not enter this competition (I did the coding example just for the brain exercise, but I did not submit it) because I am <a href="2012-03-13-google-io-2012-here-i-come" title="Google I/O 2012 Here I come">already registered for Google I/O</a> and didn&#8217;t need the additional ticket for myself, but some of my coworkers did enter the competition, and they received an email a little while ago which included the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you know, we intended to provide an opportunity to buy Google I/O tickets to the top 100 scorers. <strong>In light of our mistake, we&#8217;ve decided instead to offer this opportunity to all participants who have submitted any solution to either of the two problems</strong>. Please watch your inbox for a registration code coming shortly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That does indeed seem &#8220;least unfair,&#8221; everyone who tried the contest, gets to go to Google I/O.  If you are among those, (like my fellow coworkers), I look forward to seeing you in San Francisco on June 27th.</p>

        <p>I mentioned last week that <em>Pottermore</em> is set to open to the public on April 1st, <a href="2012-03-20-pottermore-to-finally-open-up-on-april-1st-unless-its-a-cruel-joke" title="Pottermore to finally open up on April 1st, unless it’s a cruel joke">unless it is a cruel April Fools day joke</a> to potter fans.  It seems the Pottermore team is hoping to dispel the fears that it might be a joke by <a href="http://insider.pottermore.com/2012/03/harry-potter-ebooks-and-digital-audio.html" target="_blank">releasing</a> part of the site (a part that wasn&#8217;t previously even available to beta users) today!  The <a href="http://shop.pottermore.com/" target="_blank">Pottermore Shop</a>, where we can finally purchase Harry Potter e-books, is now available in the US and Britain (with <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/faq-language" target="_blank" class="broken_link">other regions and languages coming soon</a>).</p>

<p>I do almost all of my reading these days on a Kindle or Kindle related app because I love the portability of it.  It has been extremely annoying for years that my favorite book series isn&#8217;t available on Kindle, because they are the books I&#8217;d most like to have with me at all times.</p>

<p><amp-img  src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/03/Region-capture-17.webp" alt="Pottermore Shop" title="Pottermore Shop" width="720" height="620" layout="responsive" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>When I travel, I tend to need to bring several books with me because with all the extra reading time I tend to plow through a few books, and I just can&#8217;t carry the entire Harry Potter series in my carryon, so you can be sure I will be picking up the Complete Harry Potter Collection (for $57.54) very soon.</p>

<h3>The Great:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Buy once, get both .mobi (Kindle) and .epub versions!</li>
<li>No DRM Crap to deal with, this will work on every .mobi and .epub reader</li>
<li>Still supports Whispersync on Kindle even though you aren&#8217;t buying from Amazon!</li>
<li>Also supports Google Play and Nook</li>
<li>Audio books also have no DRM, plain .mp3 files!</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Good:</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/harry-potter-ebooks?c=USD" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Price for ebooks</a> is good, if not great. (<a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp1-ebook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">SS</a>, <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp2-ebook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">CS</a> and <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp3-ebook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">PA</a> are $7.99 each, <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp4-ebook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">GF</a>, <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp5-ebook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">OotP</a>, <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp6-ebook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">HBP</a> and <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp7-ebook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">DH</a> $9.99 each, or <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hpbundle1-7-ebook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the whole set</a> $57.54)</li>
<li>Audio books are cheaper than the CD versions previously available</li>
<li>Store is easy to use and purchase</li>
</ul>

<h3>The NOT so Good:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Audio books are still <a href="http://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/harry-potter-audio-books?c=USD" target="_blank" class="broken_link">way too expensive</a> (<a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp1-audiobook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">SS</a>, <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp2-audiobook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">CS</a> and <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp3-audiobook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">PA</a> are $29.99 each, <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp4-audiobook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">GF</a>, <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp5-audiobook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">OotP</a>, <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp6-audiobook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">HBP</a> and <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp7-audiobook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">DH</a> $44.99 each, or <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hpbundle1-7-audiobook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the whole set</a> for a whopping $242.94)</li>
<li>I can&#8217;t buy the books on Amazon (or with my kindle directly) or on iTunes, kinda not very friendly to people who are used to buying that way.</li>
<li>It won&#8217;t let me buy the British editions, even though I prefer them (Actually being familiar with Alchemy, I&#8217;ve always preferred to read &#8220;Philosopher&#8217;s Stone&#8221; to &#8220;Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone&#8221;)</li>

        <p>Back in January, my wife and I went to see <em>Beauty and the Beast in 3D</em>, part of a trend of older movies getting the 3D treatment we&#8217;ve been treated to this year.  While I enjoyed the experience, I think I mostly just enjoyed seeing <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> in theaters again, the 3D was just so-so.  It reminded me a lot of pop up books, each layer was flat and it was just a bunch of layers stacked on top of each other to give the 3D effect.</p>

<p><amp-img  title="Beauty and the Beast" alt="Beauty and the Beast" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/03/Top1-e1332466623625.webp" width="280" height="249" layout="intrinsic" lightbox>
    <amp-img fallback title="Beauty and the Beast" alt="Beauty and the Beast" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/03/Top1-e1332466623625.jpg" width="280" height="249" layout="intrinsic" lightbox></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>The play was good overall.  I like what they did to explain the characters appearing more &#8220;human.&#8221;  In order to excuse the fact that the characters are played by humans instead of animated candlesticks and teapots, is changed the story slightly so that the change from human to inanimate object is a gradual one.  A short time into the play the winder appeared on the back of Cogsworth, where previously he didn&#8217;t have it.</p>

<p>Not only did this excuse the human appearances, but it also had the advantage of increasing the urgency of the situation in the story.  The implication is that eventually they will be completely inanimate, unable to move or speak, making the breaking of the spell that much more important to the characters.</p>

<p>The productions of the songs from the movie were excellent in the play, especially &#8220;Be our Guest,&#8221; &#8220;Gaston,&#8221; and the title song &#8220;Beauty and the Beast.&#8221;  The song added to the play that was cut from the original movie (&#8220;Human Again&#8221;) was likewise excellent, however they also added many additional songs, presumably to lengthen the play, and not a single one of the additional songs was any good (in my not humble opinion).  They were dull, and a times made me so bored I found myself wondering if the song would ever end so we could get back to the dialog (not what you are supposed to be wondering when watching a musical).</p>

<p>Overall I really enjoyed seeing <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> the musical, and I&#8217;m looking forward to catching <em>Mary Poppins</em> when it <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.broadwaysanjose.com/shows/marypoppins.html">comes to town</span> in late May.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;ve been fighting with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/">PubSubHubbub</a> protocol over the last few days.  I apologize for the test posts which have been causing annoyances to what few readers I actually have.  For those of you who have no idea what PubSubHubbub is, it is a method of allowing people to get updates about new blog posts in real time (or near real time).</p>

<p>RSS and Atom Feeds have been around for a long time, and they are great at dispensing the content of a blog or site in an easy to consume format.  However just like the home page of the blog, they are just files, sitting on a website waiting for someone to fetch them.  When I write a new post, or change an existing post, people who subscribe to my feed must fetch the feed again in order to know something has changed.</p>

<p>Most feed fetchers do this by what is called &#8220;polling,&#8221; which simply means every X minutes, it goes and fetches the feed again and compares it against what it got the last time it checked the feed.</p>

<p>PubSubHubbub allows feed fetchers to instead subscribe to get notified whenever there is a new post on a feed.  I won&#8217;t bother going into the details of how it works here, but the basic gist is that whenever your blog (the &#8220;<strong>Pub</strong>lisher&#8221;) gets a new update to it&#8217;s feed it posts this just once to the <strong>Hub</strong> (a server that handles the bulk of the process).  The Hub then looks through it&#8217;s list of <strong>Sub</strong>scribers, and does an HTTP Post to a callback url provided by each subscriber, which includes an abbreviated version of the feed&#8217;s contents (just the post(s) that have changed) which the subscriber can then process immediately, rather than waiting till it&#8217;s next scheduled update time.</p>

<p>Simple in theory, in practice it&#8217;s been a pain to work with.</p>

<p>The &#8220;real&#8221; price last year was $550 with an early-bird discount of $450, so when you consider there are no early birds this year, the increase is 38.9% for 50% more conference, so perhaps the increase isn&#8217;t so bad.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twas the Night before Christmas, and in the Geek&#8217;s House<br />
  The only thing stirring was the Geek&#8217;s mouse</p>
  
  <p>The stocking was hung by the Plasma with care,<br />
  In hopes that <a href="http://www.ups.com/">UPS</a> soon would be there;</p>
  
  <p>He was busy coding, no time for bed<br />
  Visions of source code, danced through his head</p>
  
  <p>Wearing a ThinkGeek t-shirt, and a Tux cap,<br />
  He <a href="http://www.noradsanta.org/">tracked Santa Claus</a> on the Google Earth App</p>
  
  <p>When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br />
  He clicked straight to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> to research the matter.</p>
  
  <p>News site and blog he clicked like a flash,<br />
  When nothing he found, to the front door he dashed.</p>
  
  <p>When, what to his wondering eyes should appear<br />
  but a big brown truck, it was finally here!</p>
  
  <p>With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br />
  A UPS man, did you think St. Nick?</p>
  
  <p>More rapid than eagles, his charges they came,<br />
  The Geek whistled, and shouted, and called them by name</p>
  
  <p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/?&amp;tag=capslog-20&amp;camp=211493&amp;creative=379973&amp;linkCode=ez&amp;adid=1PRSNK7GXJ04D1CX9FWZ&amp;">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>, <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">ThinkGeek</a> and <a href="http://www.zappos.com/">Zappos</a>,<br />
  Great gifts bought online, he wondered who sent those.</p>
  
  <p>The man brought them out and stacked them up high<br />
  So many presents, they reached to the sky.</p>
  
  <p>He had a broad face, and a little round belly<br />
  That shook when he laugh&#8217;d, like a bowl full of jelly</p>
  
  <p>When finally done with stacking straight as a line<br />
  he brought out a clipboard and pen and said, &#8220;Sign&#8221;</p>
  
  <p>Then placing one finger aside of his nose,<br />
  The man gave a nod and into the truck he rose</p>
  
  <p>He turned his key, and drove down the lane<br />
  The geek looked down at brown packages plain</p>
  
  <p>He opened the first, and smiled when inside<br />
  An iPod from his mother, wrapping paper did hide</p>
  
  <p>The second he found, was a Blu-Ray from a friend<br />
  Such generosity, his heart it did mend</p>
  
  <p>Boxes and boxes, each one he did ope&#8217;.<br />
  Each tech gift filled him with joy and hope</p>
  
  <p>My story is done, to me it did Psych<br />
  A Geeky Christmas to all, if you enjoyed it click <amp-facebook-like width="90" height="20" layout="fixed" data-layout="button_count" data-href="2011-12-24-the-geeks-night-before-christmas"></amp-facebook-like></p>

        <h2>Happy Binary Day!</h2>

<p>So in addition to being <a href="2011-11-11-thank-you-veterans" title="Thank you Veterans">Veteran&#8217;s Day</a>, today, November 11, 2011, happens to be the last &#8220;Binary Day&#8221; I am ever likely to live through.  There have been 36 so-called &#8220;Binary Days&#8221; in the last 11 years (9 each in 2000, 2001, 2010 and 2011), where all the days of the date (except the century) consist of only the digits 0 and 1.  As a computer programmer, I can&#8217;t help but be tickled by days that appear to be in binary.</p>

<p>Today however, the 6 digit binary calendar hits its max at 11/11/11 and so there will not be another binary day (at all) until January 1, 2100 <em>(which could be represented as 01/01/100 for that extra binary digit goodness)</em>.  As this is over 88 years away, if I manage to live to it, I will be 117 years old, which isn&#8217;t very likely.</p>

<p>I say that makes this day worth remembering.  Some are calling it #NerdNewYear (the hash tag makes it extra nerdy), in Redwood City, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://nerdnewyear.com/">big block party</a> currently counting down the seconds till 11/11/11 11:11:11 pm.  Unfortunately I couldn&#8217;t make it to the party tonight, but I wish all my fellow Hackers and other Nerds a great time at the party.</p>

<p>Happy Binary Day Everyone, Enjoy it, it will probably be your last.</p>

<p>The first problem with the house point championship is in just a month we are dealing with point values in the tens of thousands, when in the books the house cup championship is only in the hundreds after an entire year.  Granted, there&#8217;s just under 400,000 &#8220;students&#8221; on Pottermore, and at best estimates, Hogwarts has at most a thousand (according to a <a href="http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-scholastic-chat.htm">Scholastic Chat with J.K. Rowling in 2000</a>), and more realistically <a href="https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2001/02/07/how-many-students-are-there-at-hogwarts/">approximately 280 students</a> (based mathematically on the assumption of more or less 10 students per year per house, based on the <a href="http://www.pottermore.com/en/book1/chapter11/moment1/the-original-forty">40 students</a> in Harry&#8217;s Year).  </p>

<p>But even with the enormous population growth at Hogwarts since <a href="https://www.hp-lexicon.org/source/the-harry-potter-novels/dh/dh36/">1998</a> (I guess the wizarding world is producing a lot more magical children now that the Dark Lord is gone, if there are 400,000 students at Hogwarts), house points at Hogwarts are far more likely to normalize out at far lower levels then 40k in a month.</p>

<p>Pottermore is surprisingly balanced actually for the houses actually, considering house selection is supposedly based only on the results of the Hat Quiz, and not on how full the houses are.  I am surprised that the number of students are more or less equal. 97,417 members in the most populous house (Hufflepuff) and 96,240 in the least populous house (surprisingly, to me anyway, Slytherin house), a difference of only 1,177 people, or just 0.3% of the total.  The houses have more or less the same number of people.</p>

<p>Interesting to note that the house with the most students actually has the lowest number of points, and the house with the fewest students is currently winning.  I think this has something to do with the fact that Catastrophically failing at brewing potions (which annoying sometimes happens even if you follow all of the instructions to the letter) loses you 5 house points, while the easiest potion successfully brewing can only earn 3 house points.  Couple with that the fact that the cheat I mentioned a couple weeks ago no longer works for earning house points quickly, and I would expect to see the number of house points actually even out or even start dropping as more people fail then succeed.</p>

<h2><em>&#8220;Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,&#8221; said Dumbledore. &#8220;However, recent events must be taken into account.&#8221;</em></h2>

<p>I have a great deal of sympathy for the team developing Pottermore as they attempt to keep the house cup fair.  I have some experience at doing the same thing in that I have developed a similar House Cup championship for the <a href="http://www.hogwartslive.com/">HogwartsLive</a> text based Role Playing Game.  On HL, I, like I imagine TH_NK, found it very difficult to come up with an algorithm that more or less gives every house an equal shot at winning the house cup.</p>

<p>The difficulty I found was in creating a system that rewards activity, but is not prone to &#8220;gaming the system&#8221; which is hard when points are generated automatically.</p>

<p>The staff of HL debated back and forth on if automated house points should work and how they should work for a long time, many believe that house points should only be given and taken by the staff, others think that staff should be unable to give or take house points as that is unfair to people who don&#8217;t chat.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure we ever got it right, and I&#8217;m not sure Pottermore will ever get it right either, but I sympathize with the team and the enormous task they have.  The fact that the house cup is so close overall and has changed hands several times in recent weeks, is a testament to the fact that they are doing their best.</p>

        <p>I don&#8217;t know if the people from <a href="http://www.think.eu/">TH_NK</a> read <a href="2011-08-27-pottermore-cheats-earning-more-house-points-through-failure-then-success-in-potion-making" title="Pottermore Cheats: Earning more house points through failure then success in potion making">my post about cheating</a> on <a href="https://www.nickmoline.com/tags#pottermore">Pottermore</a> by purposeful failing at potion making, or one of the many other online forums posting about the issue, but a few days after my post went live, they posted on the Pottermore Insider blog that <a href="http://insider.pottermore.com/2011/09/from-duelling-to-potions.html">potions are being tweaked</a>.</p>

<p>Today Sara Moton commented on my previous post to say that they stopped giving a point for failing.  I have logged in tonight to test it and indeed, it is true.  TH_NK has fixed this logic flaw, and it&#8217;s great.</p>

</amp-img></p>

<p>Apparently there was another way of cheating with potions that I never tried cause I presumed they wouldn&#8217;t base things on system clock.  In what some are calling the &#8220;time turner&#8221; cheat of potion brewing, you can simply set your system clock ahead and return to the potion page, and skip the lengthy waiting/brewing period.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t personally verify that this was true, but it didn&#8217;t work for me tonight, so if it was, TH_NK has fixed this as well.</p>

<p>There is another form of cheating with potion making, that is not fully fixed yet.  <a href="http://seekerrose.wordpress.com/2011/08/28/pottermore-cheats-ruining-the-fun-of-all-4-houses/">SeekerRose184 talks on her blog</a> about people purposely failing in the catastrophic way in order to purposely lose points.  The goal, nothing short of sabotage.  While the situation is being made better by apparently adding a <a href="http://seekerrose.wordpress.com/2011/09/04/pottermore-takes-action/">bottom cap</a> on personal house points of 0, it is clearly not a fix, and I&#8217;m not sure what they can do to stop this sort of sabotage.</p>

<p>Still, it is great to see TH_NK working to make Pottermore a better and cheat free place.  In addition to removing the free ride points, they&#8217;ve also finally <a href="http://seekerrose.wordpress.com/2011/09/12/potions-magical-points/">varied the points</a> on potion making so that harder potions are now worth more points.</p>

<p>I am still enjoying the site and am looking forward to seeing the site continue to grow as October approaches, and beyond.</p>

<p>I want to give an extra thanks to Spike and Guest who both let me know in comments on my previous post that there is in fact a way to send a message to the developers other then posting on my blog.  It turns out, in the <a href="https://www.pottermore.com/en/help#other">Other section of the Help</a> on Pottermore.com, if you open up the What&#8217;s next? FAQ entry, there is a little link titled &#8220;Need more help?&#8221;  If you click this link (sorry it&#8217;s a javascript link so I can&#8217;t direct link it for you), you are given a small form that allows you to send a message to the developers.  Thanks Spike and Guest for letting me know about this.</p>

        <p><strong>UPDATE 9/14/2011:</strong> <a href="2011-09-14-pottermore-cheats-potions-better-still-needs-more" title="Pottermore Cheats Update: Potions are Better now, but the site still has a way to go">TH_NK has updated Pottermore</a> so that you no longer earn house points when you fail to brew a potion, this simple fix nullifies the cheating method mentioned below, Hurrah!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to preface what I&#8217;m going to say below with the statement that I am not putting this post up as an invitation to cheat on pottermore.  I would have sent this message privately to the Pottermore developers, however I could find no place on pottermore.com, insider.pottermore.com, <a href="https://twitter.com/pottermore">@pottermore</a> or pottermore on facebook where I could send a message to the devs.  The closest I could find was the Beta Feedback button, which presents a feedback form that lets you rank a page on a scale of how much you like it, but it has no comment field, no way to introduce a comment for the devs.</p>

<p>My hope is that by posting this publicly on my blog, the Pottermore devs will find this post and fix the issue (and perhaps add a method of commenting privately to the devs).</p>

<!--more-->

<p>So the problem with Potionmaking in Pottermore is that you can earn far more house points from failure as you can from success, at least in a given time frame.</p>

<p>If you successfully brew a potion, you earn 5 house points, but successfully brewing a potion takes a minimum of 85 minutes (different potions take longer, 80 seems to be the minimum wait time between the 2 steps and even if you are fast your additional time of actually doing the steps will take you an extra 5 minutes). While a potion is brewing for the 80 minutes, you cannot brew any other potions (even if you own multiple cauldrons), you simply have to wait out the 80 minutes and then come back.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2011/08/Screen-Shot-2011-08-27-at-2.30.12-PM.webp" title="Earning a point from failure" alt="If you fail to brew a potion, you earn 1 house point" width="835" height="396" layout="responsive" lightbox>
  <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2011/08/Screen-Shot-2011-08-27-at-2.30.12-PM.png" title="Earning a point from failure" alt="If you fail to brew a potion, you earn 1 house point" width="835" height="396" layout="responsive" lightbox></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>If you fail to brew a potion, you still earn 1 house point, as soon as you get into the potion making session, wave your wand, you&#8217;ll &#8220;fail&#8221; to make the potion, but will still be awarded 1 house point, but this takes a minute (or less). If you take 85 minutes of doing one &#8220;attempt&#8221; per minute, you will earn 85 house points, 17 times as many points as you could possibly earn in that same amount of time by brewing the potion correctly.</p>

<p>Granted, you will eat through the potion ingredients pretty quickly going about it this way, but if you stick to the &#8220;cheap&#8221; potions, that is to say the potions that don&#8217;t involve expensive ingredients like bezoars, your hundreds of galleons given to you by pottermore will last you for quite a few house points.</p>

<p>I know many other people have figured out this simple realization that you can earn more points through failure then you can from success, but what isn&#8217;t clear is if the Pottermore devs are aware of it yet, my hope is that if they aren&#8217;t, that this post will clue them in that the potion making process really needs some serious thought.  As it is, there is next to no incentive (other then acquiring a vial of potion) to actually going through the lengthy process to create the potion successfully.</p>

        <p>For her 9th birthday, Rachel Beckwith asked people to donate to charity:water rather then give her presents. Sadly when her birthday arrived she was $80 short of her goal of raising just $300 for charity:water.</p>

<p>A month after her birthday she died in a car crash, in the month since her death, donations on her page have reached $1.1 million for bringing water to children in Africa.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Today, August 19th, is <a title="World Humanitarian Day 2011" href="http://ochaonline.un.org/whd/" target="_blank">World Humanitarian Day 2011</a>, and I found out Rachel&#8217;s Story on <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/08/19/world-humanitarian-day-2011/#237336-Rachel-Beckwith">Mashable's article of 12 incredible internat activists</a> who made a difference.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t often write pieces about charity here on my blog, because I figure people won&#8217;t read them, but Rachel&#8217;s story touched my heart.  When setting up her donation page she wrote this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On June 12th 2011, I&#8217;m turning 9. I found out that millions of people don&#8217;t live to see their 5th birthday. And why? Because they didn&#8217;t have access to clean, safe water so I&#8217;m celebrating my birthday like never before. I&#8217;m asking from everyone I know to donate to my campaign instead of gifts for my birthday. Every penny of the money raised will go directly to fund freshwater projects in developing nations. Even better, every dollar is &#8220;proved&#8221; when the projects are complete, and photos and GPS coordinates are posted using Google Earth. My goal is to raise $300 by my birthday, June 12, 2011. Please consider helping me.</p>
  
  <p>Thank you so much!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said, she didn&#8217;t reach her goal before her birthday.  $300 would have been enough to give clean water to 15 people.  After her untimely death she has raised enough to provide clean water to nearly 60,000 people.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s honor the memory of this extraordinary child by <a href="http://mycharitywater.org/rachels9thbirthday">helping her raise even more</a>, her $1.1 million will go far, $2 million will go even farther.  <a href="http://mycharitywater.org/rachels9thbirthday">Visit her donation page to help out</a>.</p>

        <p>Ever since the Profiles feature was first announced in the canary build I was excited, but it was limited (biggest limitation, these profiles weren&#8217;t saved) and the canary build was very unstable at the time. Eventually that early version moved into later builds, but the canary build updated further to allow saving those profiles for later use (making switching between different identities easy).</p>

<!--more-->

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2011/07/Region-capture-30.webp" title="Chrome Profile Switch" alt="Chrome Profile Switch" width="469" height="323" layout="intrinsic" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>It would seem that the updated profiles (with the profile icon and saving the profiles for later) have now moved into the beta build, which I use on a day to day basis. I am really excited about this feature as I routinely have to use multiple accounts on various website throughout the day and it&#8217;s annoying to constantly have to sign out and sign back in to use it.  This is especially true on google.com now that Google Apps for Domains accounts are full fledged google accounts.  I have my company email account, my personal email account, and still another shared company account we use for certain things, and switching is quite annoying, especially if I forget which account I&#8217;m in.</p>

        <p>So I really like Google+ and happily post away to my Google+ Profile.  Unfortunately not everybody has access to G+ yet.  Facebook still is king of the ring, but I&#8217;ve long wanted to do what Google+ does natively, which is to say specify who should see my posts based on groupings.</p>

<p>It turns out, facebook does have this feature, but it only works from the Facebook Website (not from the mobile apps or through the API) and it&#8217;s a lot more kludgy to use then it is in Google+.  </p>

<!--more-->

<p>Step 1) Write your post in the normal &#8220;What&#8217;s on your mind?&#8221; box as usual, but don&#8217;t click Share yet.</p>

<p><amp-img title="Posting to a social group (step 1)" alt="Posting to a social group (step 1)" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2011/07/Region-capture-1.webp" width="522" height="104" layout="intrinsic" lightbox>
  <amp-img fallback title="Posting to a social group (step 1)" alt="Posting to a social group (step 1)" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2011/07/Region-capture-1.png" width="522" height="104" layout="intrinsic" lightbox></amp-img> 
</amp-img></p>

<p>Step 2) Instead of clicking the Share button, click the little lock next to it bringing up a drop down of Privacy options.  Select Customize from this dropdown.</p>

<p><amp-img title="Facebook Selective Sharing Step 2" alt="Facebook Selective Sharing Step 2" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2011/07/Region-capture-2.webp" width="518" height="270" layout="intrinsic" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>Step 3) In the &#8220;These people:&#8221; drop down, select &#8220;Specific People&#8230;&#8221; and in the text box that pops up, begin typing the name of the facebook list you want to share with.</p>

<p><amp-img title="Facebook Selective Sharing Step 3" alt="Facebook Selective Sharing Step 3" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2011/07/Region-capture-4.webp" width="555" height="368" layout="intrinsic" lightbox>
  <amp-img fallback title="Facebook Selective Sharing Step 3" alt="Facebook Selective Sharing Step 3" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2011/07/Region-capture-4.png" width="555" height="368" layout="intrinsic" lightbox></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>Step 4) Click on Save Setting, and then click on the Share button and your post will go only to the specific list(s) you selected, just like Google+ (just more time consuming)</p>

I find myself constantly looking at it to see how many steps I&#8217;ve made during the day and checking the flower to see if it is healthy or wilted.</p>

<p>My favorite feature is the activity mode.  When I do actual exercise and I hit the treadmill, I can switch it to activity mode and get down to the minute statistics of how well I did.  I love this tracker and highly recommend it for people who want to track their daily activity.</p>

        <p><a href="2009-08-31-nickpro-migrated-to-drupal" title="Nick.pro Migrated to Drupal">Over a year ago</a>, I migrated nick.pro from WordPress over to Drupal.  I did this so that I could experiment with Drupal more, thinking I could make a more robust site if I did so.  Unfortunately, while Drupal is a fantastic, flexible platform for web development, it is simply not efficient as a blogging tool.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Drupal was so cumbersome to use as a blogging tool that I ended up stopping blogging altogether.  So for the first time in years of migrating this blog around and around, I&#8217;m reverting it back to a previous home on wordpress.</p>

<p>In the last year wordpress has come a long way, with lots of great new features that makes blogging even simpler then it was before.</p>

<p>I in no way mean to bash drupal, it&#8217;s still far and away the best CMS system out there for developing complex sites, but for a blog&#8230; it&#8217;s good to be home.  My hope with this migration back to WordPress is that it will lite a fire under me to blog again.  No more can I shirk my blogging responsibilities with the whine that writing a post in drupal is just too much work.</p>

        <p>I revisit my blog after a busy May, 2011 including going to Google I/O 2011 and what do I see as the last post on my blog, a short stinger post about Google I/O 2010. This simply won&#8217;t do.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve written other blog posts in the last year, they just haven&#8217;t been on my own blog. I&#8217;ve written a <a href="http://onward.justia.com/author/nickmoline/">number of blog posts</a> in the last year on <a href="http://onward.justia.com/">Justia&#8217;s Law, Technology and Legal Marketing Blog</a>. I&#8217;m well past due however writing blog posts for myself. I will make an effort to pick back up on this as it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always enjoyed.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll begin with some general updates. Two blog posts ago (March, 2010) I was blogging about making a difficult decision regarding looking into adopting a child. While we did look into pursuing that angle, sadly the mother of the child in question changed her mind and decided to keep the child herself. We haven&#8217;t given up hope of having a child someday (hopefully not too far in the distant future) but sadly God has other plans for us right now it seems.</p>

<p>I have been incredibly busy with work over the least year and I love working for Justia. We&#8217;ve put out some great projects in that time including <a href="http://answers.justia.com/">Justia Legal Answers</a> which I had the privilege of <a href="http://onward.justia.com/2010/11/09/announcing-justia-answers/">writing about on the Justia Blog</a> and <a href="http://onward.justia.com/2011/04/19/announcing-justia-daily-opinion-summaries/">Justia Daily Opinion Summaries</a> which was part of a revamp of our <a href="http://law.justia.com/">Justia Law Center</a>. More projects are, as always, underway and I look forward to pushing out some great new features in the upcoming days.</p>

<p>In my personal life, I&#8217;ve gotten to do quite a lot of exciting things this year, which I&#8217;m going to try to write separate posts for. Going to Disney World for the first time and visiting the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in the process, Going on my first Cruise, Visiting New York City (3 Times!) and getting my first (and second) taste of Broadway and Time Square.</p>

        <p>Last Sunday I posted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nickmoline/posts/366770667619">the following message on my facebook</a>.</p>

<p>Naturally, many of my family and friends are curious just what this &#8220;huge decision&#8221; is. After consulting with both of our families, and some other trusted advisors, we have made our decision, and I can now share what the decision was about with you.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><amp-facebook width="552" height="310" layout="responsive" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/nickmoline/posts/366770667619"></amp-facebook></p>

<p>As those of you who know me best are aware, the greatest desire of my heart has always been to become a father, and Barbara, my wife, has likewise always yearned to be a mother. Unfortunately, previous medical treatments Barbara received when she was young for Lupus, make the possibilities that we will ever be able to have a child naturally incredibly slim. As a result of this, we have long since resolved ourselves that when we were ready to have a family, adoption was likely to be our only option.</p>

<p>A friend of ours who is pregnant is unable to keep the baby herself, and approached Barbara and Me with the proposition that she would like us to consider adopting her child.</p>

<p>This is a tremendous opportunity, as the adoption process is long and complicated, and a big part of that complication is the matching would-be parents with children. The prospect of someone seeking us out and choosing us in advance to be the parents of their child is a wonderful and amazing opportunity that is unlikely to ever happen again.</p>

<p>Naturally our hearts lept at the chance that we could become parents, but it was still a difficult decision. Were we ready to start a family? The timing is not exactly perfect, my wife was nearing the end of her first quarter back in school after many years. She was just starting on the path to get a degree in accounting, and that process would have to be put aside (or at least be put on the back burner for a while) if we chose to become parents now.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s more, our room-mate Mike was a factor to consider. We have relatively cramped living conditions as it is, we will have to either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Move into a larger apartment that can hold a 4th member of our household.</li>
<li>Move into a house.</li>
<li>Kick Mike out of our apartment and lose the extra help in paying the rent (not to mention kicking a good friend out on the curb)</li>
<li>Try to make do with our current living conditions until we can do one of the first 2 (or Mike moves out on his own)</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course the cost is to be concerned, both before and after the adoption process is complete. Adoption is very expensive, often costing tens of thousands of dollars. And of course, I don&#8217;t need to tell any of you who have children just how expensive they can be once you have them.</p>

<p>There was also our support structure, the question arose, would our parents support this decision, or would our decision to adopt, cause a distance between us and our families?</p>

<p>Fortunately, this last issue was a non-issue. Our parents have been extremely supportive in this. Both Barbara&#8217;s and My Parents not only say they will support us, no matter what decision we make, but they all believe that we will make good parents.</p>

<p>After a lot of prayer, and a lot of seeking guidance from those we love and Trust. Barbara and I have decided to go forward with adopting this child. It is going to be a long and difficult process. We need to have social workers come and do a home study to stamp a seal of approval on us as parents before the state will allow us to adopt, and that is not a cheap (nor easy) process. After that, there are the legal costs to be considered. I&#8217;m not sure at this moment how we will raise the lump sums necessary to adopt this child, but we have decided that becoming parents, and becoming the best possible parents we can be to this child, are worth the difficulties that may come with it.</p>

<p>I thank you all for your prayers and consideration, and ask you to keep us in your thoughts, hearts, and prayers as we proceed with this process.</p>

<p>I will of course keep you all posted. The next step is going up to where the mother of the baby is and witnessing her next Ultrasound appointment in a few weeks. I am very much looking forward to getting to see, what I am choosing to now refer to as &#8220;My Baby&#8221; on that ultrasound.</p>

        <p>So tonight was fun.. Amazing how things can bring back both such fond and such painful memories at the same time. I went to a play tonight, &#8220;25th Annual Putnum County Spelling Bee&#8221; and they were looking for volunteer spellers and I was chosen.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Fond memories of being on stage again, little bit of improv involved as I had to play along with the actors.</p>

<p>As for the painful memories, just like the last spelling bee I got out on my first word. It was such a hard word I don&#8217;t even remember what it was, the other 3 volunteers had easy words their first rounds (one of them had Cow, another Fandango) but me not so much.</p>

<p>Entertaining though, when the volunteer asked them to use &#8220;Fandango&#8221; in a sentence, the sentence was:</p>

<p>&#8220;I see a little silhouetto of a man, Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gotta love a Queen reference.</p>

        <p>A Major pre-christmas internet outage seems to be hitting the heavy hitters on the web right now. Amazon.com, Salesforce.com, and Walmart.com are all offline right now, perhaps even more. Interestingly enough sites running on amazon web services (AWS EC2) seem to be running just fine. An outage of these large sites at the same time is likely a result of an attack of massive proportions.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It appears the outage was actually isolated primarily to the west coast of the US, and was actually an outage of ultradns.com which provided dns for all of the above sites and many others, including netflix and newegg.</p>

<p>EC2 and S3 never actually went down, but S3 urls that actually used s3.amazonaws.com were not functioning, so while many sites with S3 images stopped loading, twitter, which also uses S3 for image hosting did not have a broken image because they had their own dns pointing to S3&#8217;s ips. I also didn&#8217;t notice the EC2 servers being down, but that was because I access EC2 servers with other dns names, not amazonaws.com, had I tried to access them using amazonaws.com urls, I surely would have had difficulty.</p>

        <p><strong>UPDATE: I was right, tonight <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/join-this-group-google-groups-joins.html" target="_blank">Google announced Google Groups is now part of Google Apps for Domains</a>!</strong></p>

<p>This morning I noticed a change in the way emails sent to a group (formerly known as list) email address on google apps for domains appear. Below is an example of the bottom of the email headers on an email sent to one of my groups on nick.pro:</p>

<!--more-->

<p><amp-img title="Old Mailing List MIME Headers" alt="Old Mailing List MIME Headers" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2011/05/oldmailinglist.webp" width="958" height="187" layout="responsive" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>On the other hand here is the bottom of the email headers on an email sent to that same group today:</p>

<p><amp-img title="New Mailing List MIME Headers" alt="New Mailing List MIME Headers" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2011/05/newmailinglist.webp" width="953" height="255" layout="responsive" lightbox>
  <amp-img fallback title="New Mailing List MIME Headers" alt="New Mailing List MIME Headers" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2011/05/newmailinglist.png" width="953" height="255" layout="responsive" lightbox></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>As you can see in these images, a few new list specific header lines have been added that make lists appear more like they were handled by more traditional mailing list software, rather then a simple email forwarder.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve confirmed this change seems to have happened today as emails to groups as recently as yesterday do not have the additional headers, while emails to the same groups today have the additional headers, hop past the break to see a breakdown of the 4 new headers and what I think this change means:</p>

<hr />

<p>The important new headers are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>List-Help</strong>, which contains both a link to a support for the mailing list, as well as a new listname+help@domain email address for list support</li>
<li><strong>Sender</strong>, which is now set to listname+owner@domain rather then being left off of the header (and thus defaulting to the original sender&#8217;s From: address</li>
<li><strong>X-Original-Sender</strong>, which is the original &#8220;sender&#8221; in this case the same as the from address</li>
<li><strong>X-Original-Authentication-Results</strong>, which contains the SPF parsing results from when google processed the original email</li>
</ul>

<p>What does this mean? I think it means Google is finally making an effort to turn the groups in Google Apps for Domains (already taking a step closer to real mailing lists earlier this year when they improved the permission system on who can send email to the list), into real mailing lists closer to the popular Google Groups service. If this is true, and I hope it is, we should be seeing additional Google Groups type features (such as archiving, subscription, and digest options) coming to Groups in Google Apps for Domains soon.</p>

        <p>I have successfully migrated the nick.pro site from the WordPress blog that it has been for ages, into Drupal. This is perhaps the most unusual migration of this blog (and I&#8217;ve moved this blog several times now), in that I don&#8217;t actually consider Drupal to be a better blogging software then WordPress, in fact, I find WordPress to be the absolute best blogging software available today. However I&#8217;ve long wanted nick.pro to be something more then just a blog, I&#8217;ve wanted it to be a whole site showcasing what I&#8217;m up to online and off, and Drupal is a far better CMS platform for a more robust site then just a blog.</p>

<p>While Drupal works fine as a blog, where it really shines is in it&#8217;s flexibility. There are <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/Modules/">Third Party Modules</a> available to do almost anything you can imagine, and for those things you can&#8217;t imagine, it&#8217;s a robust php framework for coding my own modules to do even more incredible things.</p>

<p>For the moment, all I&#8217;ve accomplished is migrating my old blog content, making sure all of the URLs redirect correctly, and adding an activity stream to show my recent activity on various online sites (<a href="http://twitter.com/nickmoline">twitter</a>, <a href="http://digg.com/users/portalcap">digg</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/portalcap">youtube</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nickmoline/">flickr</a> to start, more to come).</p>

<p>This is far from the first time I have migrated my blog. Stay tuned after the break for a brief glimpse of how this site has progressed from &#8220;Cap&#8217;s Log&#8221; on Movable Type 2, to Nick.pro running on Drupal today.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><a href="https://www.nick.pro/2003/07/11/pop-into-internet-pop-culture">Originally</a>, this blog (which used to be a subdomain of subspacelink.com) ran on Movable Type 2, which at the time was an excellent platform (and still is in it&#8217;s version 4 update). At the time I was primarily a perl developer, so it made sense to standardize on a perl platform, I quite enjoyed finding <a href="https://www.nick.pro/2004/02/22/mt-plugins">Plugins</a> for MT and even writing a few of my own.</p>

<p>Nearly a full year after the blog launched, <a href="https://www.nick.pro/story/2004/06/28/blogcms-v30-xe">I made it&#8217;s first major migration</a> to <a href="http://blogcms.com/">BLOG:CMS</a>, which is based on the <a href="http://nucleuscms.org/">Nucleus CMS</a> Blogging platform. My primary reason for this migration was that I could no longer upgrade Movable Type without paying a license fee, and as I much preferred Open Source software, I decided the time had come to migrate to a new platform.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Nucleus never quite seemed a clean enough system for me, and BLOG:CMS made it much messier, and <a href="https://www.nick.pro/2004/07/22/busily-updating">upgrades to new versions were a real pain</a>, so I was always on the lookout for another blogging platform to switch to.</p>

<p>The Nucleus system was such a pain to work with, that eventually I just stopped blogging entirely, and there came a point where there was a space of over 15 months with not a single post. Eventually I <a href="2006-05-01-missing-year">Migrated to WordPress</a> in May, 2006 and used it continually until today.</p>

<p>As I said above, WordPress is a phenomenal blogging software, the best there is, and I will miss some of it&#8217;s simplicity and functionality on my site now that I have <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">Gone Drupal</a>, but the time has come that I want more out of my personal site then a blog, and Drupal will give me the flexibility I need to do much more with my site then ever before.</p>

        <p>A few months ago I <a href="2009-02-04-google-chrome-extensions-coming-out-by-may">blogged</a> that an extension listed on the Google I/O session list implied that Google was ready to release extensions for Google Chrome.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m attending the <a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions/DevelopingExtensionsGoogleChrome.html">Developing Extensions for Google Chrome</a> session right now, which is hosted by <a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/speakers.html#aa">Aaron Boodman</a> who is noted for being the creator of the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey Firefox Extension</a> and who now works at Google, and is working on Chrome Extensions. He Started this session with a disclaimer &#8220;This is alpha code, we are not announcing Extensions for Chrome today&#8221; (see my <a href="http://twitter.com/NickMoline/status/1938360780">Tweet of Disappointment</a> at that).</p>

<p><amp-twitter width="375" height="472" layout="responsive" data-tweetid="1938360780"></amp-twitter></p>

<p>That said, the way extensions are handled in Google Chrome is actually really cool. Extensions are very simple to implement, and I&#8217;m probably going to write some development Chrome Extensions as early as this week, unfortunately no NORMAL user of Chrome will be able to install it (only people using the dev release of chrome and who manually install it can use them). Still interesting, but my exclamation of February that earned me lots of pageviews as it showed up on Techcrunch, CNET, Lifehacker, and Mashable (and many others), was unfortunately wrong, and I&#8217;m not to big to admit it (certainly if I didn&#8217;t admit it, someone would do so in the comments, and rightfully so).</p>

<p>Am I totally disappointed? In this yes, but in I/O, for one thing, it was announced during the keynote today that <a href="http://twitter.com/NickMoline/status/1938126329">every attendee of I/O gets a free <strong>unlocked</strong> Android Mobile Phone</a>, WITH a free month of unlimited voice and data service on it, very cool.</p>

<p><amp-twitter width="375" height="472" layout="responsive" data-tweetid="1938126329"></amp-twitter></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The Session video is now up on youtube, I&#8217;ve embedded it below:</p>

        <p>My wife and are are checked into our hotel in San Francisco. Tomorrow begins <a href="http://code.google.com/io">Google I/O 2009</a> at the Moscone Center West in San Francisco. I&#8217;m quite looking forward to two days of Google Developer Goodness. I&#8217;m hoping that we&#8217;ll learn about a lot of great new updates to Google APIs and developer tools, and of course, I haven&#8217;t forgot about my prediction that <a href="2009-02-04-google-chrome-extensions-coming-out-by-may">Google Chrome will get Extensions at Google I/O</a>. I&#8217;m a little more cautious about saying that for sure, but I&#8217;m still pretty optimistic that it will happen, or at least we&#8217;ll get some sort of time table as to when we will.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>After all <a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions/DevelopingExtensionsGoogleChrome.html">Developing Extensions for Google Chrome</a> is still on the Agenda, in the very first timeslot of the conference (after the Keynote that is) in fact. I&#8217;m expecting to get a formal announcement about Extensions either during the Keynote itself, or at least during that particular session.  But we&#8217;ll find out if I&#8217;m right tomorrow.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll find time to write up some notes I took from the Conference over the next couple of days, but if it is anything like last year, time will be short indeed.</p>

<p>On a related matter, if any of my readers are here at Google I/O, leave me a comment, or tweet to me <a href="https://twitter.com/nickmoline">@nickmoline</a>, I&#8217;m looking forward to meeting with fellow developers during the conference.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I <a href="http://twitter.com/NickMoline/status/1598161878">retweeted</a> a <a href="https://readwrite.com/2009/04/23/geocities_closure_signals_end_of_an_era/">post by ReadWriteWeb</a> concerning Yahoo&#8217;s announcement that they are <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/geocities/geocities-05.html">closing down GeoCities this year</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><amp-twitter width="375" height="472" layout="responsive" data-tweetid="1598161878"></amp-twitter></p>

<p>This was particularly sad news for me because GeoCities was where my first website was hosted. Within a day of getting the internet at home for the first time (On December 26th, 1995) I signed up an account at GeoCities, which was at Area51/Labyrinth/1226 (it&#8217;s long since gone so there&#8217;s no point in me linking to it here), but that site eventually evolved into <a href="http://www.subspacelink.com/">The SubspaceLink</a>.</p>

<p>I had a great time on GeoCities back in the 90s, and even was a volunteer for them as part of their Community Leader program, and even had stock in the company (a measly 10 shares, but stock nonetheless).</p>

<p>In 1999, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-220817.html">Yahoo purchased GeoCities</a> for about $4.5 billion, and my 10 shares of GeoCities became 6 shares of Yahoo, their stock split twice since then (in 2000 and 2004), so now I have 24 shares of yahoo, which I <abbr style="border-bottom: dotted 1px" title="Of course I should have sold the 12 shares back in 2000 when it was going for $97 a share in March and got $1,164 instead of the $353.52 it's worth today">still hold today</abbr>.</p>

<p>Yahoo didn&#8217;t waste any time in terminating the Community Leader program (a decision I always thought was a bad one, as the since of community was what made GeoCities great).</p>

<p>Anyway, this is more rambly then most of my posts, so I&#8217;ll probably end up editing or deleting it later, but I wanted to do something fun. I just checked to make sure it&#8217;s true but my old geocities email address still works (after all these years), so drop me an email at it at <a href="m&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#116;&#x74;&#x6e;&#x67;&#x66;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x40;ge&#111;&#99;&#105;&#116;&#105;&#101;&#115;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#115;&#116;&#x74;&#x6e;&#x67;&#x66;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x40;ge&#111;&#99;&#105;&#116;&#105;&#101;&#115;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a> so I can enjoy it again just a little bit more before Geocities dies forever.</p>

<p><sup>*</sup> The cover photo wasn't actually from any real geocities site, instead it was a parody of GeoCities style fan sites created by Dreamworks for the movie _Galaxy Quest_.  The site has been down for years, but you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020413083055/http://www.galaxyquest.com/galaxyquest/index.html">find it on the Wayback Machine</a>, Enjoy!</p>

        <p>Earlier this month, I wrote about <a href="2009-03-06-twitter-tip-better-replies-in-tweetdeck" title="Twitter Tip: A Better @replies List in TweetDeck">tracking mentions of yourself on twitter</a> more completly then just checking the <a href="http://twitter.com/replies" target="_blank">@replies tab on twitter</a> (or in tweetdeck).  Keeping tabs on what people say about you in twitter is only one step in effectively tracking references to yourself online.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>So here&#8217;s step 2, if you want to really know what people are saying about you online, take the search a step further and check out what is being said about you on blogs.</p>

<p>Here is a slightly modified version of the same search string I used on Twitter to track mentions of me.</p>

<pre><code>"Nicholas Moline" OR "Nick Moline" OR NickMoline OR link:nick.pro -site:nick.pro
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I <a title="Find Nick in Google Blogsearch" href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?scoring=d&q=%22Nicholas+Moline%22+OR+%22Nick+Moline%22+OR+NickMoline+OR+link%3Anick.pro+-site%3Anick.pro" target="_blank">plug this search in at Google Blogsearch</a>, I see mentions of me on blogs around the web.</p>

<p>Think of <code>-site:nick.pro</code> the same way we thought of <code>-from:NickMoline</code> on the twitter search, it is pointless to see mentions of my own name on my own site, so I quickly filter out my domain name from the results.</p>

<p>The <code>link:nick.pro</code> is similar to <code>to:NickMoline</code> on twitter search, by adding in <code>OR link:nick.pro</code> I will get posts that link to me even if they don&#8217;t mention me by name.</p>

<p>Once I had the results, I sorted by date, and then clicked the link on the bottom of the page to view the feed in Google Reader, now whenever someone mentions me on their blogs, I&#8217;ll be notified as soon as Google ads the post to their index.</p>

        <p>For the second year in a row, my wife and I participated in Earth Hour. At 8:30 I hit the main breaker in our apartment shutting everything down for an hour. During that time we read together by candlelight and reflected on just how much energy we use on a day to day basis. It was amazing to us how quiet it was without the ambient hum of electronics running, serving our whims, and it was humbling to think how hard it seemed to read by candlelight and how much we rely on technology for every aspect of our lives.</p>

<p>If you didn&#8217;t participate in <a href="http://www.earthhour.org/">Earth Hour</a> this year I urge you to do so next year. It&#8217;s a simple and symbolic way to focus on saving energy and the mounting energy crisis.</p>

    <title>iPhone 3.0 Supports Both Local AND Exchange Calendars and Contacts</title>

        <p>When Exchange support was added in the iPhone 2.0 software last summer, turning on Exhange Syncing for Contacts or Calendars was an exclusive action.  Once you turned on Exchange Calendars you could no longer sync your calendars on your iPhone with your computer directly.  It appears that in the iPhone 3.0 that this is no longer the case.  I upgraded to the beta of 3.0 last night and when I attempted to setup Google Syncing again with my calendars, I got the screen on the right.</p>

<p><amp-img title="What would you like to do?" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2009/03/img_0001.webp" alt="What would you like to do with the existing calendars information on your iPhone?" width="320" height="480" layout="intrinsic" class="alignright" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>Previously, doing this action would prompt me that all existing calendars on the iPhone would be deleted, now it asks what to do with the calendars already on the iPhone with an option to keep them intact.  This indicates that Apple is planning on removing the limitation of supporting either Exchange OR synced content but not both.</p>

<p>Unfortunately iTunes seems to not know what to do with this yet, and if I don&#8217;t delete the synced calendars, iTunes is not able to do anything with them.</p>

<p>Also unfortunate is that the iPhone will still only support 1 exchange account, an attempt to add a second Exchange Account brings up the familiar &#8220;Only one Exchange ActiveSync account can be configured.&#8221; message.  While most business users will only have one Exchange account to sign into, Google&#8217;s recent move into adding ActiveSync support to Google Calendar and Google Contacts means that at least some of those business users with business accounts on their company Exchange servers may want to setup their personal Google Calendar and Contacts as well, and they&#8217;ll be out of luck.</p>

<p>This is still good news, however, for anyone who needs their corporate calendars and contacts but has their own calendars and contacts on their computer as well that they would like to sync.  Kudos to Apple for this non-touted but useful feature.</p>

        <p>Both Twitter and TweetDeck (as well as most other Twitter Clients) give you an easy way to get a list of responses people sent you.  On Twitter itself, this is the @Replies tab off of your home page. TweetDeck gives you a Replies column by default, and if you delete it, you can get it back by clicking on the replies button <amp-img title="Replies button in TweetDeck" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2009/03/region-capture-3.png" alt="Replies button in TweetDeck" width="30" height="28" layout="fixed"></amp-img> on the top of the screen.  TweetDeck&#8217;s replies button uses the replies twitter feed feature from the Twitter API to work, so it returns the exact same list that you get on the home page.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found however, that I often want to track everything that is said to or about me, even if they are not technically @replies.  Because of this I&#8217;ve ditched the replies column in my TweetDeck and instead have created my own @replies list of sorts using the Search feature in TweetDeck which uses the Twitter Search API. To do this yourself follow the simple instructions after the break.</p>

<li>Click on the Search icon in TweetDeck <amp-img title="Search Button in TweetDeck" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2009/03/region-capture-4.png" alt="Search Button in TweetDeck" width="26" height="30" layout="fixed">

<li>When you receive the to enter in what you are searching for, enter in a search where you put in all of the possibilities that someone could find a tweet about you separated by OR and end it with <strong>-from:<em>YourTwitterName</em></strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The -from:<em>YourTwitterName</em> will filter out messages that come from you, this is important especially if you write a lot of tweets and don&#8217;t want to dominate the feed of tweets that are supposed to be ABOUT you rather then BY you.</p>

<p>In My Search Box, I&#8217;ve entered in the following phrase:</p>

<pre><code>NickMoline OR "Nick Moline" OR "Nicholas Moline" OR Nick.pro -from:NickMoline
</code></pre>

<p>In this Case <a title="Follow @NickMoline on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/NickMoline" target="_blank">NickMoline is of course my Twitter Name</a> so I search for any tweet that includes that exact twitter name, but filter out messages that came from me, but I also search for <code>"Nick Moline"</code>, <code>"Nicholas Moline"</code> and <code>"Nick.Pro"</code> (this site) to find any other possible mentions of me.  I was surprised to find out that there were a number of posts on twitter that mention me that were not specifically @replied to me.</p>

<p>This tip isn&#8217;t exclusive to TweetDeck either, that&#8217;s just how I use it, you could also <a title="Search mentions of NickMoline" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=NickMoline%20OR%20%22Nick%20Moline%22%20OR%20%22Nicholas%20Moline%22%20OR%20Nick.pro%20-from%3ANickMoline&src=typed_query" target="_blank" class="broken_link">plug that search in at search.twitter.com</a> directly, and then get an Atom feed of the results that you can subscribe to in Google Reader or any other Feed Reader application.</p>

        <p><a href="2008-08-27-keeping-in-step-how-to-sync-your-iphones-calendar-with-google-calendar">Back in August, I posted a how-to</a> on keeping your iPhone (or iPhone 3G) and Mac in sync with Google Calendar all the time over the air, it basically required using both <a href="http://www.me.com/">Mobile Me</a> and <a href="http://spanningsync.com/?r=H3EFCF" title="Spanning Sync - Save $5 off the normal price of $25">Spanning Sync</a> with an Always On Mac to make sure your iPhone was kept in constant sync with both your Mac and Google Calendar.</p>

<p>At the time, it was the only solution available to make this possible, now however, Google has made it all so much easier, and cut out all of the cost, in fact, I&#8217;m sure Apple is not too pleased about how Google has made it possible to have two way over-the-air syncing with iPhones for free, thus making their $99/year Mobile Me Service all but unnecessary to most people.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here is how to keep your Mac (which no longer needs to stay online 24/7), your iPhone, and Google Calendar all in sync for Free.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>A few weeks ago now (and while I haven&#8217;t blogged about it yet, I&#8217;ve actually used this new feature since day 1), Google setup an ActiveSync server (oh the irony of Google using the Microsoft Exchange protocol) so you can now setup your iPhone to have Push syncing with Google Calendar and Google Contacts (no mail yet, hopefully soon). </p>

<p><a title="Sync: Set Up Your iPhone or iPod Touch" href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=138740&ctx=sibling&topic=14252" target="_blank">You can find the instructions on how to setup your iPhone or iPod Touch for Google Calendar and/or Contact Syncing here</a>.</p>

<p>If you have more then one calendar, Google will let you select up to 5 calendars to sync two-way with your iPhone/iPod, <a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=139206&topic=14252" target="_blank">you can find instructions on how to select which calendars to sync here</a>.</p>

<p>On your Mac you have a 3 choices on how you can keep iCal in sync with Google Calendar.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you don&#8217;t need to be able to change your calendar from iCal, <a href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=37111&topic=15286" target="_blank">simply use the iCal Public Feed Export link</a> from Google Calendar, you use the iCal &#8220;Subscribe&#8221; feature to subscribe to the calendar&#8217;s feed in iCal, and you can see everything posted on iCal.</li>
<li>A better method is to use Google Calendar&#8217;s new CalDav Support, which will give you two-way syncing between iCal and Google Calendar, <a href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=99358#ical" target="_blank">you can find instructions and a simple-to-use tool here</a>.</li>
<li>You can <a href="http://spanningsync.com/?r=H3EFCF" target="_blank" class="broken_link">still use Spanning Sync to sync your Calendars and Contacts with your Mac</a> as well, at $20 a year it&#8217;s a lot cheaper then Mobile Me, and it removes some of the quirks with using CalDav (like strange sync slowness issues that appear randomly from time to time) by syncing in the background on a schedule.  Also by using Spanning Sync, your calendars from iCal&#8217;s perspective are completely native, rather then remote, which makes them work a bit cleaner, of course, the problem with Spanning Sync is the delay, events you edit in iCal may take a little bit before they show up on Google Calendar or your iPhone.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first couple options will work even if you don&#8217;t have a Mac, you can use the iCal Public Feed Export link in any iCalendar compatible scheduling program, and CalDav is also supported in some other scheduling programs (such as Mozilla SunBird).</p>

        <p>That&#8217;s right, I said it, and so far I&#8217;m the only one who has. Google <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10110247-2.html">has announced</a> that extensions are coming to Google Chrome but have been mum on when. However I saw something today, that indicates the timetable may be short. Google officially <a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/">opened up registration</a> for Google I/O 2009, their third annual (first one was just called Google Developer Day) Developer&#8217;s Conference.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><amp-img title="Google Chrome Extensions Session at Google I/O 2009" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2009/02/region-capture-2.webp" alt="Google Chrome Extensions Session at Google I/O 2009" width="835" height="345" layout="responsive" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>Like last year, it will take place at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Along with the open pre-registration, they&#8217;ve also posted a <a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html" class="broken_link">list of Sessions</a> (subject to change). High up on the list is a session entitled &#8220;<strong>Developing extensions for Google Chrome</strong>&#8221; which contains the following description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learn how Google Chrome makes it easy to write extensions using the web technologies you already know. This talk will cover the basics of the extension system (distribution/packaging, installation, updates), as well as the different APIs to enhance with the browser.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d say this is a safe bet that if Extensions are not released BEFORE Google I/O, then they will be released as a new feature AT Google I/O. Extensions are coming, but what about Mac Support?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE FROM GOOGLE I/O:</strong> While the session went through as planned, it turns out <a href="2009-05-27-i-was-wrong-turns-out-chrome-extensions-arent-ready-yet">my theory was wrong</a>, they simply aren&#8217;t ready to announce support for extensions yet, although it is coming soon, and they are really well implemented in beta.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2 (June 3rd):</strong> The Session video is now up on youtube, I&#8217;ve embedded it below:</p>

Lewis" href="http://www.narniafans.com/" target="_blank">NarniaFans.com</a>.  I don&#8217;t normally bother to post Narnia related news here, because I feel that I would never be able to do the justice that a dedicated site such as NarniaFans can do, however today my Google Reader showed me <a href="https://narniafans.com/2009/01/in-new-zealand-prince-caspian-dvd-rental-also-contains-book/" target="_blank">an article relating to Narnia that caught my attention for more reasons then The Lion</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>In New Zealand, the New Zealand Book Council&#8217;s agency (Colenso BBDO) in Auckland, New Zealand, <a href="https://narniafans.com/2009/01/in-new-zealand-prince-caspian-dvd-rental-also-contains-book/" target="_blank">has come up with a rather ingenious way to try and get more young people to read</a>.  When people in New Zealand rent Prince Caspian on DVD from video rental stores in Auckland and the surrounding areas, they see the DVD on the left, and on the right a number of pages, in fact, they see the first 2 chapters of Prince Caspian by C.S. Lewis, with a title page that contains the question &#8220;Is the book better than the movie?&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt like posting about this story here because I love anything that encourages young people to read.  When I was growing up, the Chronicles of Narnia were some of my personal favorite books to read, and I read them over and over again, today sadly a lot of young people who go to see these movies (which are fantastic), don&#8217;t even realize that these wonderful books exist.  By putting the first couple of chapters of a book in with the DVD Rental, perhaps children who enjoy the movie will decide to read the accompanying beginning of the book, and when they get hooked, will head to their local library to grab the rest of it.</p>

<p>This could obviously work for series other then Narnia, imagine if the Harry Potter DVDs included the first two chapters of their accompanying books. I know by chapter 2 of Philosopher&#8217;s Stone, I was hooked on J.K. Rowling&#8217;s style.</p>

<p>And why limit it to the DVD release, have movie theaters hand out pamphlets of the first chapter of Inkheart after children go to see that imaginative tale this month.</p>

<p>I applaud the New Zealand Book Council for trying out this imaginative campaign to bring more young people to literature.  It is my belief that with more children reading books, we will have a much brighter tomorrow.</p>

        <p>I recently migrated nick.pro and other sites from regulus over to a new server named Atlas, it&#8217;s much more powerful, but there were some hiccups in the transfer that I&#8217;m slowly having to iron out.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I also just upgraded WordPress to the new 2.7, and I must say, I&#8217;m not a big fan of the all grey interface, but I&#8217;m liking some of the new features, for example the QuickPress block on the Dashboard that let me write this post without having to leave the dashboard at all.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working a lot of extra hours as of late in order to put new things live on Justia, and it&#8217;s had a few negative side effects. Last Wednesday night I was up all night working on things for Justia and then only got an hour and a half of sleep before having to get up Thursday for another day. Unfortunately that hour and a half was obviously not enough, because I fell asleep in the shower and crumbled to the floor of the bathtub, bashing my knee against the metal soap dish, and then on the floor of the tub hard before jolting myself awake.</p>

<p>The doctor said I mildly dislocated my patella and sprained one of the ligaments that connects the bones down there. All throughout the past weekend up until today I&#8217;ve had to walk with a cane to keep the pressure off my knee.</p>

<p>Last night I had another all-niter of work, but fortunately didn&#8217;t injure myself again, tonight it&#8217;s 2:20 a.m. as I write this and I&#8217;m about to go to bed, so there&#8217;s a little rest for the weary, but it&#8217;s worth it. Tonight I pushed some significant improvements to a Justia site, which I might blog about later.</p>

        <p>As I <a href="2008-11-11-mashup-camp-next-week">Posted about last week</a>, I attended Mashup Camp at the Computer History Museum this week. It has been a packed couple of days. I mentioned before I was not really considering entering the Speedgeeking Contest that occurs at each Mashup Camp. Last Spring&#8217;s Mashup Camp I was a bit depressed to come in last place, but this contest was different, this time they had one top prize (A MacBook Pro) awarded by attendee voting, but then the individual providers sponsoring the event also had their own contests of who had the best mashup using their service.</p>

<p>Even charged with that information, I still felt like I didn&#8217;t want to enter the competition, not really because of the agony of defeat, but because of the work that would be involved to do a mashup. However, when I heard about the <a href="http://www.wetpaint.com/">Wet Paint</a> <a href="http://www.wetpaintinjected.com/">Injected</a> API, I knew I could in a relatively short period of time, write an awesome mashup using this service, and so I <a href="http://twitter.com/NickMoline/status/1010573893">started considering it</a> on Monday evening, a few hours later, <a href="http://twitter.com/NickMoline/status/1010695410">I resolved myself and knew I had to give it a shot</a>.</p>

<p><amp-twitter width="375" height="472" layout="responsive" data-tweetid="1010695410"></amp-twitter></p>

<p>Mashup Camp was fun, especially the Speedgeeking and the Keynote from Tim O&#8217;Reilly, but the highest point of all for me was when the representatives from WetPaint announced in the closing reception that my mashup had won the Wet Paint Best Mashup Contest!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m so excited about this, that I&#8217;m going to cut this blog post short and go celebrate. Thank you to Wet Paint for both putting up an incredible Wiki Injection API for adding wiki content to pages (rather then adding pages to wikis), and for choosing my project for the Win, and thank you to the organizers of <a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/">Mashup Camp</a> for organizing a great Unconference.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2008-12-03:</strong> I just noticed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110812164552/http://blog.wetpaintinjected.com/?p=53">WetPaint team&#8217;s Blog Post wrapping up their experiences at MashupCamp</a> and wanted to thank them for the prize (which arrived Today via FedEx), and for the card which is now pinned to the wall of my Cubicle. Check out their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110812164552/http://blog.wetpaintinjected.com/?p=53">tales of upgrades to First Class</a> at the end of their post, which I presume is on Virgin America, due to the mention of Massage Chairs.</p>

<p>Last spring, I went to Mashup Camp with my coworker <a href="http://www.vuquoc.com/">Dan</a>, and competed in their <a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/best-mashup-contest/">SpeedGeeking Best Mashup Contest</a>. Dan did rather well, scoring 4th place with his iPhoneLocator Facebook App (although he&#8217;s rather disappointed as only the first 3 places won prizes), and I unfortunately came in last place. I haven&#8217;t decided if I&#8217;m going to compete again or not, but I can guarantee you if I do, I refuse to get last place again.</p>

<p>This years event looks like it will be fun however, including a <a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/mountain-view-november/schedule.php">Keynote</a> by <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/tim/">Tim O&#8217;Reilly</a>, Founder and CEO of <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O&#8217;Reilly Media</a>, which, among other things the company does, is my favorite publisher of Technology books.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m way behind blogging about this, as <a href="http://www.vuquoc.com/2008/08/29/mashup-camp-7-mountain-view-ca/">Dan blogged about it back in August</a></p>

        <p>Throughout the year there are a number of &#8220;Awareness Months&#8221; for various diseases and disorders, and while I sympathize with people with these disorders, and have a tendency to donate to their various goals, most awareness months have little personal effect on me. October however is different, in that I have a personal reason to support <a href="http://www.livingwithlupusblog.com/2008/10/october-is-lupus-awareness-month/">Lupus Awareness Month</a></p>

<!--more-->

<p>I have not posted here in my blog about this before, but most of you who know me personally are aware that my Wife has battled with the horrible auto-immune disease known as Lupus. When she was 12, it nearly killed her, and I would never have known the woman who is the Love of my Life.</p>

<p>Lupus is an auto-immune disease, which in layman&#8217;s terms is like the opposite of AIDS, instead of having no immune system, people like my wife have an over-active immune system. Their immune system is so vigilant in it&#8217;s destruction of things that it determines is a &#8220;foreign contaminant&#8221;, that it gets confused, and starts attacking tissues in the body as well. The end result is that the white blood cells literally destroy the body from the inside out.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2008/10/m-o.webp" title="Foreign Contaminant Detected" alt="Foreign Contaminant Detected" width="400" height="208" layout="responsive" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>There is no cure for Lupus, and it kills, and funds for research are desperately needed in the search for a cure. So please, check out <a href="http://www.lupus.org/">The Lupus Foundation of America</a> or <a href="http://www.lupusresearch.org/">the Alliance for Lupus Research</a> and learn how you can make a difference in the research of this deadly disease.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about Lupus, I recommend you check out the <a href="http://www.livingwithlupusblog.com/" class="broken_link">Living with Lupus Blog</a>, written by my wife, Barbara Moline, or visit <a href="http://www.lupus.org/">lupus.org</a> or <a href="http://www.lupusresearch.org/">lupusresearch.org</a></p>

        <p>So I upgraded to the 2.1 software this morning on my iPhone. There aren&#8217;t any new features, but the array of fixes that <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/09/12/iphone-2-1-firmware-out-now/">Apple promises</a> with the new update are much needed, if it turns out to work.</p>

<!--more-->

<ul>
<li>Increased Call Stability</li>
<li>Better Battery Life</li>
<li>Faster Backups</li>
<li>Faster interface</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m reserving overall judgment, but so far it seems to be working just like Apple said it would.</p>

<ul>
<li>I <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/05/iphone-101-speedier-iphone-backups-three-ways/">turned backup back on</a> and the backup part of iTunes sync was done in about 5 seconds, as opposed to the HOUR or more that I&#8217;ve experienced before.</li>
<li>Since getting everything synced the way I want it, I&#8217;ve had it unplugged for several hours with both 3G and Wi-Fi on, as well as periodic checking of email, and my battery gauge still shows full.</li>
<li>The opening and closing of applications, particularly the contact list on the Phone app seems much snappier.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;ll let you know later on if it really has made an impact on the few negatives that were remaining on the iPhone 3G, but in the mean time, how about some news from the other side of the fence. Microsoft has released their second Seinfeld &amp; Bill Gates commercial, and while it&#8217;s not going to make me switch back to Windoze, I have to admit, it made me chuckle a little bit.</p>

<p><amp-youtube data-videoid="nNOohFst9Lc" layout="responsive" width="480" height="270"></amp-youtube></p>

<p>For the sake of completion, here&#8217;s the first video:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Device/dp/B000FI73MA%3FSubscriptionId%3D1XFK01HK9NZWGPENWGG2%26tag%3Dnickdotpro-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000FI73MA"><amp-img src="https://i1.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mLdDed4ML._SL160_.jpg" title="Amazon Kindle" alt="Amazon Kindle" class="alignleft" width="160" height="160" layout="fixed" lightbox></amp-img></a>For those of you who don&#8217;t already know, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Device/dp/B000FI73MA%3FSubscriptionId%3D1XFK01HK9NZWGPENWGG2%26tag%3Dnickdotpro-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000FI73MA">Amazon Kindle</a> is an ebook reader that uses E-Ink technology to display content on a screen. What&#8217;s cook about e-ink is that once it has rendered the screen&#8217;s contents, it takes no power to keep the content on the screen. The result is that battery life of the kindle is measured in &#8220;page turns&#8221; instead of hours. The Kindle is also cool because it has WhisperNet, provided by Sprint, which lets you have books you purchase from Amazon&#8217;s kindle store be sent straight to the Kindle, without the need to plug the kindle into your computer. The Kindle also gets a special email address where you can email documents to this address and have them appear on your Kindle for a nominal fee for reading. All in all, it&#8217;s a fantastic product, it only has one little problem, the price. The Kindle is $349 (previously $399), available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Device/dp/B000FI73MA%3FSubscriptionId%3D1XFK01HK9NZWGPENWGG2%26tag%3Dnickdotpro-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000FI73MA">only from Amazon</a>, which is still a bit steep for an up-front cost <em>before</em> you start <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Device/dp/B000FI73MA%3FSubscriptionId%3D1XFK01HK9NZWGPENWGG2%26tag%3Dnickdotpro-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000FI73MA">buying books from the Kindle store</a> to put on it.</p>

<p>Amazon, I know you want to sell Kindles, but your bread and butter will always be the books themselves. My suggestion is that you write an iPhone app that can read the Kindle book format and will validate like a Kindle to your own DRM. You could sell this app in Apple&#8217;s app store to make even more money, I&#8217;m thinking something along the lines of $20 to $40. This way people with an iPod Touch or iPhone (which is quite a lot of people, including yours truely) can start buying Kindle books without a Kindle, and get the enjoyment of having instant access to literature the way only the elite Kindle owners do. The iPhone already has access to the internet, so it could support all of the functionality of Whispernet without any difficulty from you the developer. The iPod Touch has WiFi, so even it can download books directly when it&#8217;s on a hotspot.</p>

<p>Amazon can even take this one step further. Amazon already partners with Apple&#8217;s iTunes Music Store as a place to purchase content from it&#8217;s own Audible.com, once someone has purchased your iPhone app, partner with iTunes again and have people able to shop for books right through the iTunes music store, making it even easier for iPhone owners to purchase your Kindle books.</p>

<p>What I think Amazon may find surprising if they did this, is that it probably would bolster sails of the Kindle devices itself, not only the Kindle books.</p>

<p>See I&#8217;m a bit leery of buying a Kindle, and buying Kindle books, knowing that those books are locked to the Kindle. If I could start buying those books now, and reading them on another device, I&#8217;d probably later buy a Kindle knowing it&#8217;s a better platform for reading them on.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also not exactly outside of Amazon&#8217;s business model to offer their digital products to other platforms either. <a href="2007-03-25-tivo-making-a-come-back-watch-out-apple-tv">In March, 2007, I blogged about Amazon and TiVo teaming up</a> to make Amazon Unbox Videos (now known as Amazon Video on Demand) available on TiVo boxes. I immediately started buying Unbox videos when I never had before. Incidentally, I&#8217;d love it if Amazon Video-on-demand Videos were playable on the iPhone as well, and I&#8217;d probably buy a lot more videos from Amazon if they did, but I think that might be a bit of wishful thinking.</p>

<p>So come on Amazon, release an iPhone app that can read Kindle documents and you&#8217;ll have even more of my money then you do now, and I&#8217;d bet a whole lot of other people&#8217;s money as well.</p>

        <p>Well I feel like an idiot, as the commenter below pointed out, the link I mentioned was a bookmark itself, not a &#8220;get bookmark plugins&#8221; link, but it was showing up in my list of bookmarks, which means that, as the commenter said, this bookmark had been imported from Firefox, and was not actually an indication that Google Chrome was intending to support Firefox Extensions.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is I was so surprised to find the link, that I didn&#8217;t think about logical reasons why that link might have been there. I spun up a fresh copy of Windows on VMWare after the commenter posted, and did an installation of Google Chrome where Firefox had never existed. The link I mentioned below did not exist, which means the commenter was right, it did indeed come from an import of Firefox bookmarks. I&#8217;m big enough to admit that I&#8217;m wrong.</p>

<p>For archival purposes, my original, incorrect, blog post is after the break. My review of the things I like about Chrome still stands, although my foolish thought that Chrome will support Firefox extensions does not.</p>

The Firefox Extensions are not built to be compatible with Webkit, which Google Chrome is based on.</p>

</amp-img>
But what a lot of people seem to be missing is that on the new tab page/home page screen there&#8217;s a link that reads <strong>Get Bookmark Add-ons</strong>. When you click this link you are taken&#8230; to the Firefox Add-on site to find Bookmark Firefox Extensions. This seems to me to indicate that Google is planning on supporting Firefox plugins, why else would they link there.</p>

<p>Google Chrome is nice, it has some of the features I&#8217;ve long liked in Safari (like dragging a tab out of a window to keep work flow better) and a great UI. I&#8217;m also fond of the syntax hilighting in the address bar that shows you different parts of the URL, and the integrated searching is fast and easy to use. I&#8217;m also intrigued by the concept of separating each tab into it&#8217;s own little process world. It makes sense in some ways, but I&#8217;m always leery of having lots of processes running.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m fully ok with the fact that Chrome doesn&#8217;t yet have extensions, I expect they are coming real soon down the pipe, my only gripe is that Chrome is WebKit based, but it&#8217;s not yet available for Mac! Come on Google, Mac Users are notorious WebKit fanatics, let us play on our turf.</p>

        <p>I love Google Apps for Domains, I use it for all of my domains, I&#8217;ve even setup holodeck3.com with the Partner edition so that my users can get @holodeck3.com email accounts and services through them. Google does a lot, for free, and they do it well. I&#8217;m also a Mac an an iPhone user. I am never without my iPhone, and only rarely without my laptop.</p>

<p>Google has, over time gotten a lot better at providing me with services I need in order to keep my world more in sync. I was glad to be in the early adoption crowd of users for IMAP on GMail, and the first person among my group of friends to get IMAP support on my Google Apps for Domains accounts. This has helped a lot as my iPhone is now what I use for email when I&#8217;m away from my laptop, and in fact I find myself not going to the computer quite as often when I&#8217;m &#8220;off duty&#8221; because of it.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I love Google Calendar and prefer to have my calendar events in Google as opposed to simply a local Calendar on my computer or phone, however when I am at my computer, using iCal is so much easier then using Google Calendar (and having to keep yet another browser window open), and then of course there&#8217;s the little matter of keeping my calendar on the iPhone so I have my events easily at hand. Google has long allowed you to subscribe to a Google Calendar using iCal&#8217;s ics format, but this was one way, only allowing you to read your Google calendar in iCal, not make changes to it. Until very recently the best way to keep iCal in sync with Google Calendar is to use <a href="http://spanningsync.com/?r=H3EFCF">Spanning Sync</a>, a $25 program (use <a href="http://spanningsync.com/?r=H3EFCF">this link</a> and you can get $5 off!), that keeps your calendar in iCal in sync both ways with your calendar on Google.</p>

<p>Just last month, Google added another long requested sync feature, <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/07/28/caldav-support-comes-to-google-calendar/">CalDAV support for Google Calendar</a>. This makes things much easier (and cheaper, as you don&#8217;t need Spanning Sync). You can <a href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=99358">set up</a> your Google Calendar in iCal in such a way that any changes on Google will automatically come down to iCal, and any changes in iCal will automatically go up to Google, keeping them both in perfect harmony&#8230; but there&#8217;s a downside. The iPhone does not support CalDAV, which is funny because Apple pioneered the CalDAV protocol for iCal and OSX. If you setup a CalDAV calendar on your computer, it will be read only on the iPhone, you won&#8217;t be able to make any changes to events in the calendar from your phone, and any new events will have to be added to a separate calendar.</p>

<p>Hopefully Apple will add CalDAV support to the iPhone soon, but in the mean time, I&#8217;ve come up with a semi-clever (if expensive) way to not only keep your Google Calendar and Mac and iPhone in perfect sync, but have it so that if you make a change to an event on your iPhone, it will show up on not only your Mac but Google in a very short period of time automatically.</p>

<p>To do this you will need the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://spanningsync.com/?r=H3EFCF">Spanning Sync</a> &#8211; Spanning Sync will keep your Mac and Google Calendar in sync, and it does a remarkable job at it in fact. Still well worth the $20 if you get it using <a href="http://spanningsync.com/?r=H3EFCF">my discount link</a>.</li>
<li>Mobile Me &#8211; Ok, I know Mobile Me is Expensive at $99/year, but if you buy it from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MB824Z-A-MobileMe/dp/B001BY45QO%3FSubscriptionId%3D1XFK01HK9NZWGPENWGG2%26tag%3Dnickdotpro-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001BY45QO">Amazon</a>, you can get it for $20 cheaper, or get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MB825Z-A-MobileMe-Family/dp/B001BY0C2U%3FSubscriptionId%3D1XFK01HK9NZWGPENWGG2%26tag%3Dnickdotpro-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001BY0C2U">Family Pack</a> for $40 cheaper then Apple sells it.</li>
<li>A Mac that you don&#8217;t mind leaving running</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;m sure most of you have already figured out where I&#8217;m going with this, but if you leave a Mac running, and have spanning sync running on it, as well as having mobile me set up on both your Mac and your iPhone, then when you make a change to an event (or add or delete an event) on your iPhone, Mobile Me will sync it to your computer, which in turn will sync it back to Google. It may not be a very elegant solution, but it&#8217;s an easy way to keep your whole world connected and in sync.</p>

<p>Hopefully Apple will soon add Direct CalDAV support to the iPhone, which will render this entire expensive solution unnecessary, and give much faster syncing directly between the iPhone and Google! Come on Apple, Google added your protocol, now it&#8217;s up to you to support it.</p>

<h3>Three simpler variations:</h3>

<h4>iPhone and Spanning Sync, but no Mobile Me</h4>

<p>If you can wait till you get to your computer for your Google Calendar to be updated, you don&#8217;t need Mobile Me, your iPhone will sync with your iCal when you plug in, and <a href="http://spanningsync.com/?r=H3EFCF">Spanning Sync</a> will then sync your iCal with Google Calendar.</p>

<h4>iPhone and Mobile Me but no Spanning Sync (and no Google Calendar)</h4>

<p>If you don&#8217;t care about Google Calendar&#8230; well why are you reading my blog post on keeping your iPhone in Sync with Google Calendar! Seriously though, Mobile Me works well (despite it&#8217;s well publicized problems) for keeping your iPhone and computer in sync over the air as far as iCal goes. It also does a surprisingly good job of keeping your Address book in sync, so if you don&#8217;t care about Google Calendar but don&#8217;t want to plug in every time you make a change, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MB824Z-A-MobileMe/dp/B001BY45QO%3FSubscriptionId%3D1XFK01HK9NZWGPENWGG2%26tag%3Dnickdotpro-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001BY45QO">Get Mobile Me</a>.</p>

<h4>No iPhone, No Mobile Me, Optionally Spanning Sync</h4>

<p>Finally if you don&#8217;t have an iPhone and just want to keep your iCal in sync with Google Calendar, stick with Google&#8217;s CalDAV support. Not only is the price right (Free), but it&#8217;s also the fastest way to keep your computer in sync with Google Calendar, as any changes you make on iCal are immediately pushed to Google Calendar. Changes on Google Calendar will come to your iCal on a configurable schedule. I keep mine at 15 minutes. However there are other issues with CalDAV support as well, such as a lack of support for Unicode characters in Calendars that may make you want to use <a href="http://spanningsync.com/?r=H3EFCF">Spanning Sync</a> anyway.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;ve been a member of [Amazon Prime](http://www.amazon.com/gp/subs/primeclub/signup/extmain.html?
ref=prime_assoc_bt&amp;tag=nickdotpro-20) for over about 2 years now, and I was just thinking today what brilliant marketing it is. By paying a nominal yearly fee, I get free two day shipping, or really cheap next day shipping on everything I buy from them, but does it save me any money? See before I was an Amazon Prime member, I used to make sure that my Amazon orders reached the $25 minimum to get free &#8220;Super Saver Shipping&#8221; so I didn&#8217;t pay for shipping in the first place.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>However now that I&#8217;m an Amazon Prime member, I find myself buying things on Amazon I would normally have gone to a store and spending not only my time, which is getting less and less, but in many cases more money. Now when I need to buy something, I find myself saying &#8220;Let me check to see if Amazon has it&#8221;, and if it does for the same or less price, I buy it there. What&#8217;s amazing is, a lot of the time, Amazon has it cheaper.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got to hand it to Amazon, by coming up with a system that gives people faster shipping, they&#8217;ve got me looking to them first, instead of last for the things I need.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t tried out Amazon Prime, [Check out their free trial](http://www.amazon.com/gp/subs/primeclub/signup/extmain.html?

        <p>I&#8217;m mere hours away from taking a little vacation to Las Vegas along with my wife, and my roommate. Tomorrow morning I will board a Virgin America flight (I&#8217;m much looking forward to trying them out), for Las Vegas.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I&#8217;ve got a lot of fun planned, including one last trip to the Star Trek Experience in the Las Vegas Hilton. In fact making a final voyage to the Experience was my <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.holodeck3.com/event/2008/08/21/holodeck-3-meetup-star-trek-experience">primary reason</span> for visiting Vegas this month. This will be my fourth Voyage there (blogged about before on my blog, I&#8217;ll edit this post with links to my old posts later), and I&#8217;m sad it will be my last, but unfortunately the Experience will be <a href="http://trekmovie.com/2008/06/29/star-trek-the-experience-closing-in-september/">Closing on September 1st</a> permanently, so I had to make one last trip. This will be Mike&#8217;s first trip to the future, and he&#8217;s eager to see what he has only heard about.</p>

<p>But this trip won&#8217;t be all Star Trek, on Thursday Night, Barbara and I will be seeing Mamma Mia. We&#8217;ve seen the movie and are both looking forward to seeing the play as well. On Friday Night we will be going Medievil, and enjoying the Tournament of Kings at the Excalibur, another great treat.</p>

<p>In addition to all that planned fun, we are also going to get to see my parents, who are in Vegas right now, and our vacation plans are thankfully overlapping enough that we can see each other.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to a very enjoyable trip.</p>

        <p>In the latest in my ongoing series of Major websites experiencing outages, <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">GMail</a> has been down for at least the last hour. Google&#8217;s Mail service is excellent and over all I&#8217;ve always been pleased with it. Their servers are redundant, I don&#8217;t have problems with lost email messages, and the spam filtering is second to none. I also am a big fan of the search, filtering, and conversation features that make it the best email experience I&#8217;ve ever had, but today, it&#8217;s down, and I can&#8217;t access my email, which again slows down my productivity. But I take it as a bit of comfort, because the next time one of my sites goes down I&#8217;ll remember, even Google has server outages sometimes.</p>

</amp-img></p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to note that while the web interface (which I primarily use) is down, the IMAP appears to be fully operational, so I&#8217;m still getting new emails buzzing on my iPhone constantly, I just much prefer to work on the web based interface with all of the search functionality that makes it easy to find just the right message when I need it. I hope the server comes back up again soon.</p>

<p><em>Also before some jerk calls me a fool and tells me that I&#8217;m screwing up with my urls, it&#8217;s not just me, None of my coworkers are able to get on GMail, neither can my wife (who is not here), nor several friends online. A Simple <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?q=gmail+502&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;as_maxm=8&amp;as_miny=2008&amp;as_maxy=2008&amp;as_minm=8&amp;as_mind=11&amp;as_maxd=11&amp;as_drrb=b&amp;ctz=420&amp;c1cr=8%2F11%2F2008&amp;c2cr=8%2F11%2F2008&amp;btnD=Go">Date Based Google Blog Search</a> shows that many other people are experiencing problems with 502 errors on the GMail interface today</em></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> After getting everything operational again, Google <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/08/we-feel-your-pain-and-were-sorry.html">Blogged about the outage, apologizing for the inconvenience</a>.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;ve blogged from my iPhone before so this isn&#8217;t exactly new, but this post was written using the new WordPress iPhone native app just released in the app store today. I like it!</p>

<p>As an update I still haven&#8217;t acquired a new iPhone 3G, but JMac seems to have finally <a title="http://blog.jmaclabs.com/2008/07/22/iphone-arrives/">joined the iPhone revolution</a> and now has one. Welcome to the club JM, I&#8217;m very jealous that you got a 3G before me.</p>

        <p>Went down to the apple store with <a href="http://www.timstanley.com">Tim</a> to check out the new iPhone 3G that was released today. But even at 6:30 p.m. (the phone had already been on sale for 10 and a half hours), the line was still stretched all the way around the Apple Store. I&#8217;m going to wait and hopefully pick one up next week when I don&#8217;t have to wait quite so long to get one. The line was so long NBC News was there interviewing people waiting in line. (note the news van on the left of the image)</p>

        <p>Two weeks ago <a href="2008-06-06-amazon-down-but-not-out">I posted about Amazon.com being down for hours</a>, tonight, another major website has gone down without warning, and has a very ugly error message, just like Amazon did. At this time the error message (shown on the right) has been up for at least 20 minutes with no sign of repair, in fact, much the contrary, while the error message is still there, it is taking longer and longer for the error message to load, meaning that even facebook&#8217;s error page is under serious strain.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Update, the error message is still there, but at least facebook seems to have fixed their CSS, so as you can see to the left, the error message is much less &#8220;ugly&#8221; now.</p>

<p>Interesting a large outage like this happens on the evening of the day that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/2008/6/facebook-loses-long-time-exec">it is announced that Facebook is losing long time Executive Matt Cohler to Benchmark Capital</a></p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> It appears that facebook is now operational once again.</p>

        <p>Google is following it&#8217;s trend from last year&#8217;s Google Developer Day by posting up videos of all of the sessions on YouTube, but so far I can only find the Opening Keynote. They promised that they would upload them all within a week, so expect more parts of my reviews of Google I/O as they become available.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Below you can find the video of the opening Keynote by Vic Gundotra entitled &#8220;Client, Connectivity, and the Cloud&#8221; which was an informative way to talk about all of the primary topics of conversation at the conference.</p>

<p><amp-youtube data-videoid="vk1HvP7NO5w" layout="responsive" width="480" height="360"></amp-youtube></p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to focus this review of the keynote on the products they went through:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Gears:</strong> They mentioned gears again, and invited up a developer from MySpace who showed off how they&#8217;ve added Gears implementation to the MySpace mail to do fast real time full text search using the local database. They also praised the developers of HTML5 for taking the power of Gears and putting it into what is an upcoming standard.</li>
<li><strong>Android:</strong> Next Vic talked about Android, Google&#8217;s open source mobile stack, and brought up an Android developer to demo how Android works on a prototype model. I don&#8217;t do a lot of mobile development, so I won&#8217;t say much in any of my review articles about Android, however in the demo they did show one little sample of what could be done with an all-new mobile street view and a built in compass. The Android demo is at about 27 minutes into the keynote and I recommend you watch it because there is no way I can describe it that will match the impressive demo. One thing that is pretty cool about Android is that the web browser is Webkit, which is the same browser technology used on the iPhone. They showed off Google Grand Prix (the mobile version of google for the iPhone) and said that they did not have to make any changes for it to work on Android. This is pretty cool because it means if I develop a mobile app that takes advantage of iPhone capabilities, it will work just as well on Android devices, so perhaps I should start developing iPhone web apps after all.</li>
<li><strong>App Engine:</strong> I won&#8217;t give a review of App Engine here, because I already <a href="2008-06-01-google-io-part-1-google-app-engine">Reviewed App Engine</a> in Part I of this series. The two big announcements that they made is that anybody can register an app on App Engine now (instead of the limited 10,000 user beta previously) and that they have pricing available now for the applications that go beyond the free quotas they&#8217;ve given.</li>
<li><strong>GData APIs and AJAX APIs:</strong> Again I don&#8217;t want to review GData and AJAX APIs here because I went to a few of the sessions on this track and so I&#8217;ll review them elsewhere, plus this isn&#8217;t particularly new, as GData APIs have been out for a long time now. One thing that is really cool with the Google AJAX JavaScript API though is that they&#8217;ve added a new set of loaders in addition to their existing Google API loaders, you can now load various different versions of JQuery, Prototype, Scriptaculous, MooTools and dojo. This is pretty cool because when you develop rich applications in javascript using Google APIs, you tend to also use a javascript framework like one of the ones mentioned above. Now you can make one remote javascript load to google, and minimize the calls you have to make, very cool. It&#8217;s difficult for me to explain why this is is cool, so I won&#8217;t bother, instead, here&#8217;s another video that explains what&#8217;s great about it.</li>
</ol>

<p><amp-youtube data-videoid="qU_1_DrP04I" layout="responsive" width="480" height="360"></amp-youtube></p>

<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Google Web Toolkit:</strong> This is another product that I don&#8217;t personally use, mostly because I don&#8217;t use it as I am not a JAVA Developer. Google Web Toolkit is a set of tools and libraries that let you write an AJAX Application in JAVA, and compile it into JavaScript. I know some JAVA Developers who love this program in order to create JavaScript using JAVA, and do easy complex AJAX applications, but it&#8217;s not really for me. I generally write my own JavaScript.</li>
<li><strong>OpenSocial:</strong> Google announced OpenSocial quite some time ago, but it is starting to take off finally, and I&#8217;m excited to see some of the things I can work on with OpenSocial, but I&#8217;m not going to say much more about that here.</li>
</ol>

<p>Stay tuned for more reviews of things learned at Google I/O, particularly my upcoming review of the second day&#8217;s keynote, which was very fascinating.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>This week I, as well as <a href="http://www.barbara.pro">my Wife Barbara</a>, and my co worker <a href="http://www.danvuquoc.com/">Dan</a>, went to <a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/">Google I/O</a>. People who have read my blog for a while may remember that last year I attended <a href="2007-06-03-google-developer-day-2007">Google Developer Day</a> around this same time in San Jose. This year Google decided to expand from a single day to a whole two-day tech conference and move it to the Moscone Center in San Francisco.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>While last year&#8217;s big ticket item was <a href="http://gears.google.com">Google Gears</a>, this year&#8217;s conference was focused on the new <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>, a method of hosting a dynamic application using Google&#8217;s cloud system. App Engine is definitely impressive, and an interesting way to expand the cloud computing idea popularized by Amazon&#8217;s EC2 system, into something where the developer doesn&#8217;t have to worry about the expansion points. That is to say with EC2 you use virtual machines, and if you want to expand you are responsible for starting up another virtual machine and handling the load balancing. With Google&#8217;s system, you just upload your application and google takes care of scaling it, load balancing it, and everything. What&#8217;s more you only pay for CPU time that you are actually REALLY using. With EC2, in order to serve any sort of real requests you have to be running at least one instance all the time, and you are being charged for that instance, which will cost you about $70/month before any data transfer costs. With Google your application is always ready for requests, but you aren&#8217;t being charged for idle time (time sitting there waiting for requests), just the time that you are actually serving requests, which should make things much cheaper.</p>

<p>Several developers I talked to at the conference also said they liked the idea of App Engine over EC2 because it makes it so that the developers don&#8217;t have to do any server administration. With EC2 your instance is a virtual server, and you have to do everything with the server that you normally would have to do with a server, (installing software, configuring apache hosts, etc.) whereas google&#8217;s system just runs, always ready to accept requests.</p>

<p>But everything is not all roses with App Engine, the simplicity of scaling and administration have necessitated some pretty real limitations.</p>

<ul>
<li>No real disk access, all data storage has to be done in the database, which makes it additional work to port any existing system that requires access to files.</li>
<li>Proprietary database that is vastly different then common Relational Database systems (data is stored like an object, with properties of the object). Their database system has some cool applications to it, like the ability to interact with GData APIs directly in the database, but it&#8217;s so different than any system out there (with the exception perhaps of Bigtable on which it is based, and SimpleDB from Amazon) that it is very difficult to port applications written for say MySQL over to it.</li>
<li>What&#8217;s more there are limitations within the database itself, each bit of data is limited to 1MB, so coupled with the limitation above, if you want to store images in it, you have to make sure the images are all under 1MB or chop them up. Also, and this is a bit surprising for Google, there is no full text search in this database, so you cannot build any applications that require a full text search&#8230; at all!</li>
<li>Development in Google Apps Engine is limited only to the Python programming language, which again, limits who can use it. I for one have never learned Python, so that limits my ability to use it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, despite these caveats, I find App Engine a promising system that I&#8217;d like to try to use, but for the moment that&#8217;s hard. I&#8217;ll be sure to write an update to my review of App Engine once I have had an opportunity to actually use it. And look for more articles about my experiences at Google I/O as I get time to write them.</p>

        <p>April is here, and that can only mean one thing&#8230; practical jokes. Tuesday was April Fools day, and as usual, the jokes and pranks were out in full force. Some of them elaborate, some of them simple, and most of them funny. One of the more elaborate ones this year was a promotion done by the Nestle corporation.</p>

<p>Nestle had displays made up containing rebranded Butterfinger candy bars. The announcement on the display read that effective immediately Butterfinger candy bars are to be known as &#8220;The Finger&#8221; and to search the phrase in Yahoo to find out more. What was impressive is that the display actually contained a number of &#8220;The Finger&#8221; candy bars and they were giving them away for free. A great publicity stunt for April Fools day. Searching for the finger on April Fools day on Yahoo gave a link to a video on Yahoo! Video that outed the joke. It may be stupid, but at least I got a free candy bar out of it, as well as a chuckle (just for the record, I wasn&#8217;t fooled for a moment, it was obvious to me that it was a joke, though apparently some people thought they were serious).</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The internet of course was filled with April Fools Day jokes, the most popular of which was a joint joke by Google and the Virgin group, that they had come together to form <a href="http://www.google.com/virgle">Project Virgle</a>, a Martian Colonization project. The project was impressive, and almost believable (if it wasn&#8217;t April Fools Day, but then again, Google has been known to make <a href="http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/gmail.html">unbelievable announcements</a> on April Fools day that turned out to be true).</p>

<p>Youtube contains video greetings from both <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWCQYcPlUng">Richard Branson</a> of the Virgin Group, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmSdy_9blB4&amp;feature=user">Larry Page and Sergey Brin</a> of Google to make it all the more impressive. The clincher on this joke was a request for video applications from hopefuls wanting to join the project and go to Mars.</p>

<p><amp-youtube data-videoid="PmSdy_9blB4" layout="responsive" width="480" height="360"></amp-youtube></p>

<p>There were a number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google's_hoaxes#2008">other google April Fools jokes</a>, including <a href="http://www.google.com.au/intl/en/gday/">gDay™ with MATE™</a>, a google search feature that lets you search the web the way it will be tomorrow; Yogurt, the temporarily renamed Orkut social networking site, and <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/customtime/index.html">GMail: Google Custom Time</a>, which allowed you to mark your message as being sent in the past and have it already marked as read when your recipient checks his inbox (a feature I wish really existed sometimes).</p>

<p>I have a tradition for several years now of visiting <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/looflirpa/2008.shtml">ThinkGeek</a> on April Fools Day. For several years now, TG has put up a page of fake products that appeal to geeks, as well as offering one free real T-Shirt with purchase of other real products. This year&#8217;s jokes were as always comical (although nothing will beat the April 1st several years ago when I sent Mike to the product page for <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/looflirpa/wil.shtml">WheatoniX</a>, the Operating System created by Wil Wheaton, and he actually fell for the joke and tried to buy it). I particularly liked the idea of a <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/41/betamaxhd.html">Betamax to HD-DVD Converter</a> to convert between one format-war loser to another. Just like last year they put out a product as a joke that was so cool the users begged and pleaded with them to make it a real product, so it&#8217;s only a matter of time now before the <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/illuminated/a5bf/">Personal Soundtrack T-Shirt</a> is actually made into a real product.</p>

<p>A few days early, to meet with their posting schedule, <a href="http://revision3.com/diggnation/2008-03-27foxnews/">Diggnation announced</a> that Revision 3 had been bought out by Fox, and that Diggnation was going to become a show on Fox News, a &#8220;political version of Diggnation&#8221; with no alcohol. This was of course a joke, and they couldn&#8217;t even keep the joke going for more then 2 minutes before they blow the joke.</p>

<p>Another fast one to blow the joke is Ryan Seacrest, who came on the American Idol stage and announced that due to a complication with their Vocal Coaches, American Idol had been preempted and that in it&#8217;s place would be a celebrity edition of The Moment of Truth featuring Simon Cowell. He actually starts to walk off the stage before turning around and shouting &#8220;April Fools.&#8221;</p>

<p>One online site that I generally go to for April Fools day fun, was sadly very lacking this year. Granted, I wasn&#8217;t really expecting to see anything on startrek.com, due to the fact that CBS Interactive fired all of the startrek.com staff back in December and have not been actively working on the site all year (there isn&#8217;t a single news article in 2008 on the site, and the home page still has a banner advertising the next star trek movie coming out in December 08 instead of May 09 as it is now slated to come out. Sadly there were no jokes on April Fools day on startrek.com this year. My Favorite Startrek.com april fools day joke was in 2004, when the joke went so far as to include a video of Billingsly (Phlox) talking about the season finale, only to be drowned out by static so that nothing could be heard, ending with the phrase &#8220;and then I die.&#8221;</p>

<p>So by this point I&#8217;m sure you are wondering if I pranked anyone on April Fools Day myself, the answer is no, I did not pull anything over on anyone. The one thing I did do is a <a href="http://www.hogwartslive.com/">HogwartsLive</a> tradition, of using the &#8220;April Fools Day&#8221; HolidayTexts LoGD module to change everything said by every user on the site so that it reads like dialog written for the Sweedish Chef.</p>

        <p>Last week I attended the MacWorld Conference and Expo 2008 in San Francisco as I did last year. The reason I did not write a post on my blog for the event however is because I&#8217;m pleased to announce that I have written an <a href="https://www.llrx.com/2008/01/whats-in-the-air-at-macworld/">article reviewing MacWorld</a> for the distinguished e-zine, <a href="http://www.llrx.com/">LLRX</a> (The Law Librarian Resource Exchange). I&#8217;ve always had an itch to get into journalism and the publication of my first article in a respected online magazine is a very exciting announcement for me.</p>

        <p>Has it been a year already? It seems like such a short time ago that I <a href="2007-01-03-2006-a-nick-oddity">sat up at 2 a.m. in a hotel room in San Simeon, CA</a> writing about 2006. I claimed 2006 incredible and, an &#8220;oddity&#8221; in my life as for the first time in recent years I was not alone and sad on New Years Eve.</p>

<p>Tonight I&#8217;m starting a little early, it&#8217;s 11:31 p.m. right now as I type these words (I imagine it will take me a bit to finish writing this post) on New Years Eve, and I&#8217;m capping yet another amazing year in the life of Nick Moline.<br />
<!--more--></p>

<p>2007 was an incredibly busy year as I focused on work. Working at Justia has been incredible and I&#8217;ve vastly enjoyed my work. I&#8217;ve worked on a ton of projects that have provided incredible free legal resources to the world and I&#8217;m quite proud of the company I&#8217;m working for.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also got to have a great time on personal projects this year. Together with my wife and friends, we ballooned WizardCast to a small network of Science Fiction and Fantasy podcasts known as Wizards.FM, and got to have a good time reviewing movies. In July our co-host and my good friend Mike came out to visit us and joined us at a bookstore in San Francisco, a couple miles from the Golden Gate Bridge where we hosted the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the final book in the Harry Potter series. Tons of people were lined up in that store as we pumped up a sound system and counted down to midnight and the sales moment.</p>

<p>In October when our lease ran up, Barbara and I moved from the small, run down apartment we moved into in 2006 and moved into a beautiful larget apartment complex. One of the primary choosing criteria for the complex we chose is it&#8217;s location. Our new home is only a mile away from the new offices that Justia is moving into. Today, the last day of 2007 the Justia Staff was moving into the new offices. 2008 we are kicking off a new office, a new Justia, it is a fantastic space and I&#8217;m looking forward to working there in 2008, in fact this morning I walked to the office for the first time (quite a hike for me) it&#8217;s the start of my New Years Resolution to walk to work for the two-fold purpose of being healthier and saving money on gasoline.</p>

<p>Well I had to take a break for a few to count down to midnight with my wife and Mike and then kiss my wife as we rang in 2008. So from me and my family, to all of you, have a safe and happy 2008.</p>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>

        <p>Coworkers have recently encouraged me to get onto facebook. As people who know me well know, I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of Social Networking sites, so I resisted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nickmoline">facebook</a> for a long time, just as I resisted <a href="http://www.myspace.com/nickmoline">MySpace</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickmoline">LinkedIn</a>. Actually I resisted facebook longer, as I just got my profile up last week. I have always thought that social networking sites were a waste of time, that anyone who wanted to get ahold of me would easily find me on my blog.</p>

<p>Yesterday however, I learned something while trying to fill in the holes in my facebook profile that shook that belief way beyond its core. Unlike the other social networking sites I&#8217;ve given in on and joined, Facebook has proved to be a wealth of information concerning people of my past that I haven&#8217;t found anywhere else. I found a group on the site called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/120476367976511">Leesburg Christian School, VA Grads</a>, a whole group dedicated to people who graduated from the same school I did. I joined the group, and started adding old school friends to my friends list.</p>

  <amp-img fallback class="alignright" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2007/09/n2335901172_6580.jpg" alt="Carl Sandberg" layout="fixed" width="200" height="166" lightbox></amp-img>
</amp-img>
On the right hand side of the group page, I noticed that the first &#8220;Related Group&#8221; was entitled <em>The infamous Carl Sandburg, not the famous.</em> The name was spelled slightly wrong (his name was actually spelled Sandberg), but he was one of the greatest men I ever knew.</p>

<p>Carl Sandberg was the teacher in charge of the computer lab when I attended <a href="http://www.leesburgchristianschool.org">Leesburg Christian School</a>, actually to call him in charge of the lab was an understatement, Carl Sandberg <strong>was</strong> the computer department at Leesburg Christian School, and the man with the greatest dedication to education I&#8217;ve ever met.</p>

<p>Mr. Sandberg was a man of vast knowledge, and was infamous at LCS for his lectures. I will always remember the first day I was at LCS, checking out the computer lab and Mr. Sandberg giving me his famous &#8220;Middle Ages&#8221; lecture, one, among many, that I enjoyed listening to in my years under his tutelage. Mr. Sandberg worked harder then anyone I ever met. His dedication to educating young people prevented him from accepting a decent living from teaching, so instead he worked a second job at Dulles Airport every night that I knew him. It was through the money from his second job that he made a living for his family, at School, he put everything he could into the computer lab, spending his personal time and money to add new computers to the lab to keep the kids at the school both entertained and enlightened.</p>

<p>He bought tons of Educational software for the school as well, yet I rarely remember him playing any of them, except for one particular game, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conquest-New-World-Deluxe-Boxed/dp/B0002QSJ1E/">Conquest of the New World Deluxe</a>. He used to play the battle mini-game with anyone who would play with him. I used to play the game with him at least once a day.  In addition to his amazing lectures on history and science, he also taught a number of subjects himself, in particular languages, which was quite a passion to him. I remember once, during a school break he took a week&#8217;s vacation to travel up to Canada with the goal in mind to speak nothing but French while he was on vacation.</p>

<p>I myself took Latin with him for 3 years, and still remember to this day the first sentence he ever spoke to me in Latin (though it took him repeating it a number of times over the years before I memorized it, and I&#8217;m still not sure I have the spelling right):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lingua Latina est delinda, delinda delindissima, et calum omnes Romani, et nunc occidet me!
  -- <cite>Carl Sandberg</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>which roughly translates:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Latin is a dead Language, as dead as dead can be, it killed off all the Romans, and now it is killing me.
  -- <cite>Carl Sandberg</cite> (translated)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To this day whenever Latin comes up in conversation, I find myself saying the sentence aloud. Not that Mr. Sandberg really believed that Latin was killing anyone, he just loved that sentence.</p>

<p>What does any of this have to do with Facebook and how I have been wrong about social networking sites for years? Carl Sandberg, a man I am honored to have known and one who will always have an impact on my life, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/08/AR2007060802692.html">passed away on May 30th, 2007 of Lukemia</a>.</p>

<p>Until yesterday, I did not even know. In the month between his last day at LCS and his death, a Facebook group was created, trying to get the word out of his hospitalization and deterioration health. On the day he died Robyn Baird, an old friend from school posted this message on the facebook group, and despite all of my rambling in this post, puts it far better than I ever could.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Sandberg died today, May 30, at about 1:10 pm. Please keep his family in prayer as they grieve, especially with Father&#8217;s Day just a few weeks away. The world is a little less wise as of this afternoon.
  -- <cite>Robyn Baird</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next day, Christa Overstreet, another fellow student at LCS posted details of the funeral which was to take place on June 4th. I found out, on September 24th, 2007, nearly 4 months after he passed away. Had I made an effort to keep in touch with my fellow students from LCS sooner, I might have found out before he died, and made an effort to get in touch with the man who has had such a positive impact on my life one last time, but I, feeling that anyone who wanted to get hold of me would easily find me, forgot that I should do the same.</p>

<p>In today&#8217;s fast paced world it is important to take the time to keep in touch with those you knew before, don&#8217;t just wait for them to find you again, because you may find, as I have, that then may be too late.</p>

<p>Carl Sandberg was a great man, and while few people know him, certainly not as many people as know the other Carl Sandburg (poet). Those who have had the honor of hearing him teach will forever remember him, and the many lessons he taught, not just the ones taught in his classes and lectures, but the one he taught every day through his life spent passionately working with students. As Robyn said, the world is a little less wise without him. My prayers go to his family in their sorrows of losing him, but I know, there are few people as deserving of a place of honor in Heaven as he is. God Bless Carl Sandberg and his family.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>We at the Justia team have been working hard on improving the already fantastic service by adding in some great new features. We have already made it easy to browse through the case filings and find cases filed by court, but now we have added in a new feature, once you are on a court page, you can get a list of Judges and browse down a level further to get all of the cases seen by that particular judge. Like the court pages you can subscribe to an RSS feed of all of the cases with that judge, or filter the results more by picking a type of lawsuit and showing only particular types of cases.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The bigger upgrade however is that we have now taken the cases back further and instead of just showing cases filed since 2006, we have gone all the way back to the beginning of 2004. The reason we have added 2 additional years of cases into our system is so that we can also add in even more information about cases then ever before. We have retrieved from the Federal courts, thousands of written opinions, orders, and decisions by Judges and made them available for downloading. Cases that have written opinions are signified on Justia Federal Court filings and Dockets with a Gavel Icon (<amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/justia/gavel.webp" alt="Gavel" title="Gavel" layout="fixed" width="16" height="16"><amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/justia/gavel.png" alt="Gavel" title="Gavel" layout="fixed" width="16" height="16"></amp-img></amp-img>), while featured cases where we have retrieved all documents filed in the case are signified with a Star icon (<amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/justia/star.webp" alt="Star" title="Star" layout="fixed" width="16" height="16"><amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/assets/images/justia/star.png" alt="Star" title="Star" layout="fixed" width="16" height="16"></amp-img></amp-img>).</p>

<p>To make the Cases that have written opinions and orders easy to find we have added 2 new features. First the search box on the top of <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/">dockets.justia.com</a> has a new option to only search cases that have written opinions filed in them. Second, we have added an entirely new site Justia Federal District Court Opinions &amp; Orders which is like a filtered down version of the Justia Dockets site, showing only cases that have opinions in them, and ordered slightly differently. Instead of being ordered by the date the case was filed, the Opinions &amp; Orders site orders the cases by the date of the last filed opinion or order.</p>

<p>Like the Justia dockets site, on Justia Federal district Court Opinions &amp; Orders, you can subscribe to an RSS feed of all of the cases that have opinions in a particular state, in a particular court, with a particular judge, as well as filter any of these by type of lawsuit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll end here with just one more interesting thing of note. I&#8217;ve been <a href="https://blog.librarylaw.com/librarylaw/2007/08/working-at-just.html"><strong>Interviewed</strong></a> by the LibraryLaw Blog on these new features. So go check out the interview by <a href="https://blog.librarylaw.com/librarylaw/2007/08/working-at-just.html">Mary Minow</a>.</p>

<p>The first is a whole new way to Search Justia&#8217;s massive amounts of free legal information, and it&#8217;s thanks to a brand new service by Google (which is a commercial version of a service that has been available for free for some time) called <a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/csbe/">Google Custom Search Business Edition</a>. At it&#8217;s core, this is the same as the <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse/">Google Coop: Custom Search Engine</a> that has been available for some months. Some time ago I created hundreds of these custom search engines on Justia to search a variety of legal topics and sites, and you can find these custom search engines scattered around justia.com and it&#8217;s various subdomains. From search engines that search all law school web sites in California (or any other state) to search engines that search all of the blogs in Justia BlawgSearch, these cses have been a fantastic way to use the power of Justia&#8217;s free Legal information to search the web for legal information.</p>

<p>But now it gets better. When I first started working at Justia there were a few hundred thousand pages of free legal information put up, including our <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/">Supreme Court Center</a> which indexes cases, to <a href="https://autorecalls.justia.com/">Auto Recalls</a> which tracks all safety recall information on cars and other automobiles, not to mention the fantastic portal of free information at the main <a href="https://www.justia.com/">justia.com</a> site. But what I&#8217;m most proud of since I started working here are the projects I&#8217;ve gotten to work on that have grown that wealth of information, <a href="https://blawgsearch.justia.com/">Justia Blawgsearch</a> daily indexes well over a thousand legal blogs and makes the information searchable and trackable in a variety of ways, <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/">Justia Federal Court Filings and Dockets</a> which adds in every civil case filed in a Federal District Court and makes the information searchable by party, case type, location, and more, and <a href="https://regulations.justia.com/">Justia Regulation Tracker</a> which parses the Federal Register and makes all of the regulations passed by the government searchable and trackable daily. I didn&#8217;t do any of these tasks alone of course, and they aren&#8217;t really what I&#8217;m talking about here, but the point is that Justia.com and it&#8217;s subdomains now account for well over a million pages of content, almost all of which is free legal information.</p>

<p>While each of these projects have their own search engines that work well, sometimes you want to just be able to search all of these sites at once, and thanks to the new CSBE service from Google, we can now do that.</p>

<p>On the Home Page of Justia is a search box that searches all Justia.com subdomains, and thanks to the new XML results API in the CSBE, returns the results using AJAX and some special changes of our own to make the results easy to identify. Sure a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ajustia.com+have+a+happy+day">Google site:justia.com search</a> would allow you to search all justia.com subdomains, but some of our free information is split out onto other subdomains, and even when you get the results, it becomes hard to see the difference between one justia page and another.</p>

<p>Try the <a href="https://www.justia.com/search?q=have+a+happy+day&amp;type=justia">same search</a> on our new Justia Search powered by Google CSBE and you&#8217;ll see the same results, but marked up with the sites, and with the results flowing cleanly using AJAX.</p>

<p>The second new service Justia has released today is our brand new <a href="https://lawyers.justia.com/">Justia Lawyer Directory</a>, which differs from every other lawyer directory on the market thanks to our powerfully easy user interface and AJAX based results. No other Lawyer Directory in the world lets you get fast, relevant results with only one click. On the Justia Lawyer Directory home page you can simply click the practice area that you are interested in, and immediately be given a list of lawyers in your area that match that practice area.</p>

<p>If you want to see more lawyers, simply click the zoom out link on our Google Map, or drag the map to a new location, your results will change immediately to show you new results.</p>

<p>Google Maps aren&#8217;t the only service of Google&#8217;s that we use to set our lawyer directory apart from the rest, we also tie into the Google AJAX Search API to do google local searches to provide additional results to help you find exactly the lawyer you are looking for, even if we don&#8217;t have them in our database.</p>

<p>Add in several other dynamic features and the end result is the world&#8217;s easiest to use lawyer directory, in my humble opinion, and the culmination of work from me and the rest of the Justia team. <a href="http://lawyers.justia.com/">Check it out!</a></p>

<p>Both of these services would be possible, but completely different if it weren&#8217;t for the powerful free and commercial services put out by Google. Amazing how the giant in the web industry, is the company that helps other companies succeed. Thank you Google for providing your great services that make the web a better place.</p>

        <p>Often when someone wants to indicate that a task doesn&#8217;t take a genius, they relate the task to one of two professions, and so two common phrases you will hear on a regular basis are &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s not Rocket Science&#8221; and similarly &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s not Brain Surgery.&#8221; This seems a strange way to start a blog post, but trust me, you&#8217;ll understand in a moment.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I received an email this morning and had to take action on it that just boggles the mind, or at least my mind. One of the websites I&#8217;ve worked on (I shall not mention any specifics so as to avoid embarassing the person, whom I don&#8217;t know, who features heavily in this true story) includes a database of professionals, and allows these professionals to upload their Resume to the site to help promote themselves. The company that runs this website received a phone call this morning from one of the professionals in it, asking that their resume be removed from the site immediately.</p>

<p>What is the reason this resume needed to be removed, a resume that this professional has uploaded to the site personally? The reason is that very early on in the Resume there is a line that reads &#8220;Social Security Number: &#8221; and then a sequence of numbers easily recognizable as the individual&#8217;s social security number.</p>

<p>One does not need to be an internet professional, or a privacy professional to know that it is an insanely bad idea to publish your social security number on a website for the entire world to see, all it takes is a little common sense to know that private information like your social security number should remain private.</p>

<p>What makes the situation worse is when I read a little further into this resume, I found that this individual happens to be a surgeon, a surgeon who has experience in operating on cancerous tumors in the brain. This person quite litterally is a Brain Surgeon!</p>

<p>So to this individual and anyone else posting their resume as a PDF, or word document, or web page online for anyone to see, I have a simple word of caution. Do not post your Social Security Number publically online, do not post any information online so private that it can be used to easily steal your identity.</p>

<p>Take care of your Private Information and your Identity, after all, it&#8217;s not brain surgery.</p>

<p>On an aside note, I am now terrified of the concept of ever needing brain surgery, as I used to mentally put the surgeons who do these highly delicate operations on a pedestal of intelligence, now I&#8217;m not so sure.</p>

        <p>Just a little bit of Google humor today, I decided to do something I do every so often and do a google search for my name, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Nicholas+Moline">Nicholas Moline</a>. I was pleased to see that 8 out of the first 10 results were indeed about me (a few of which were by me), but I happened across a listing that made me smile.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Google Book Search found my name in a very old book: <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/rb0sAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA403&amp;dq=nicholas+moline">The Egerton Papers: A Collection of Public and Private Documents, Chiefly Illustrative of the &#8230;</a> contains an interesting mention on <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/rb0sAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA403&amp;dq=nicholas+moline">Page 403</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PATENT FOR SIR NICHOLAS MOLINE.</p>
  
  <p>Nicholas Moline, a foreigner in whose favour the following Privy Seal was issued, had been knighted by the King in his eagerness to augment the list of persons upon whom the distinction was conferred. He was also to have &#8220;a canton to his arms,&#8221; confirmed to him under the Great Seal of England. From the indorsement of the Lord Chancellor we should be led to suppose that Moline, at the date of the instrument, was Ambassador from Venice, but he had ceased to be so, and in the Privy Seal itself is called &#8220;late Ambassador.&#8221;</p>
  
  <p>Right trusty and right welbeloved Chancellor, we greet you well. Where we have upon the good opinion by us conceaved of Nicholas Moline, gentleman, of Venice, and late Ambassador with us from the Duke and State of that cite, bestowed upon him the honor of Knighthood, and an addition of a canton to his armes, and are pleased to give him the same by our lettres patentes under our Great Seale for the better manifestation thereof to all men. Our pleasure therefore is, that unto the bill contayning the said graunt, which is signed with our hand, you shall cause our Great Seale of England to be put, and the same so delyvered to the saide Nicholas Moline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if those spelling errors are problems in Google&#8217;s OCRing of the pages of the book or the way things were spelled in 1605 in England, but I still found it quite interesting that I apparently had a namesake who was an Ambassador from Venice, and Knighted by the King of England.</p>

        <p>This thursday I went over to my second Tech Conference since moving to the San Francisco Bay area, the first being MacWorld back in January, this time, I went to the San Jose convention Center for the 2nd annual <a href="http://code.google.com/events/developerday/mv-home.html">Google Developer Day</a>. I must say I hope that Google&#8217;s CEO tells the Apple Board of Directors a thing or two about how to hold a Tech Conference.</p>

<p><strong>Google Developer Day 2007</strong> was fantastic fun, and Google made a lot of fantastic announcements just for developers, several of which I&#8217;m going to start implementing in my work at Justia.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I really didn&#8217;t know what to expect, nothing on the website had mentioned anything about a cost or anything, and while I was reasonably sure that the sessions were free and my registration was free, I thought for sure that food would cost money, and that there would be things to buy at the event (shirts and trinkets and such), but I was wrong. I didn&#8217;t spend a dime, the entire day. When I registered, they handed me an info pamphlet, a namebadge, and a coupon to walk over to the left and pick up a free Google Developer Day 2007 t-shirt.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2007/06/google-day-lounge.webp" alt="Blogging Lounge" title="Blogging Lounge" layout="responsive" width="950" height="396" lightbox>
  <amp-img fallback src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2007/06/google-day-lounge.jpg" alt="Blogging Lounge" title="Blogging Lounge" layout="responsive" width="950" height="396" lightbox></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>The event began with a keynote by Jeff Huber, VP of Engineering at Google. He announced several new features and tools for developers. He focused on 3 particular new announcements, Maplets, the <a href="http://code.google.com/gme/" target="_blank">Google Mashup Editor</a>, and <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/" target="_blank">Google Gears</a>. But throughout the rest of the day there would be announcements of several other new features for coders. Google has put up the keynote (and many other sessions up on YouTube. Click play below to watch the keynote.</p>

<p><amp-youtube data-videoid="7vrSx3DSh90" layout="responsive" width="480" height="360"></amp-youtube></p>

<p>The most difficult part of going to this event was deciding which of the <a href="http://code.google.com/events/developerday/mv-sessions.html" target="_blank">many sessions</a> to go to. There were between 5 and 6 different sessions to attend in each session timeslot and several times through the day I had a very difficult time choosing a session to attend.</p>

<p>In the 11 o&#8217;clock session I chose to attend the <strong>Special Session: Building AJAX applications with Google Gears</strong> session led by Andy Palay. This session focused on Google Gears, a new combination of API and browser extension by Google that allows developers to bring their AJAX applications offline. With the announcement of Google Gears, they proved the concept by adding this new API to <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/05/oh-sam-i-am-can-i-read-it-on-tram.html" target="_blank">Google Reader</a>.</p>

<p>Google Reader is a fantasic online RSS newsreader, but one of it&#8217;s drawbacks has always been that you had to be online to use it. Now when you are online, Google Reader will use the Gears API to sync a copy of the data on your local machine, so that when you get on your airplane, you can just simply point your web browser to the google.com/reader URL like normal, and still read your newsfeeds, even mark them as read, tag them, and star them like normal, next time you get online, your changes will sync with the server, saving all your changes.</p>

<p>Several sessions throughout the day (starting with this one) focused on explaining how this API works and how it can be used to take <em>any</em> Ajax application offline bringing the advantages of web based applications off of the web and into environments that previously only desktop applications could enter. This is a fantastic new enhancement to the web, and I&#8217;m looking forward to implementing the Google Gears API in several projects I&#8217;m working on with Justia and personally. At the end of this session, they had us line up in the back to pick up, yet another free T-shirt, advertising Google Gears. Like the Keynote a video of this presentation is available on YouTube, click play below to see it.</p>

<p><amp-youtube data-videoid="Z4zkhY61pus" layout="responsive" width="480" height="360"></amp-youtube></p>

<p>Following this first session, it was time to break for lunch, and wow what a lunch. Exhibit Hall 1 was laid out in a massive grid of tables in the four google colors, 4 triangular shaped sections of tables, red, blue, yellow, and green. In the center of the hall was a circular arrangement of buffet tables. 16 different lunch lines to the various tables filled the room, and a variety of food choices were available, all for free. A couple tables were chinese containing Chinese Chicken Salad, beef skewers, and vegetable spring rolls. An itallian line included ravioli and something that looked like lasagna (I didn&#8217;t get close enough to this table to see what it featured), a Mexican line featured chicken fajitas and nachos, and a deli line contained various deli sandwiches.</p>

<p>There were also various arrangements of cakes at each buffet table, tables of sodas, juices, coffee, tea and water, and large fridges of ice cream (<a href="http://www.nestle-icecream.com/Pages/drumstick.asp">Drumsticks</a> and <a href="http://www.nestle-icecream.com/Pages/crunchbar.asp">Nestle Crunch bars</a>). I was shocked that such a fantastic buffet could be free.</p>

<p>Ok, back to the sessions, in the first session timeslot after Lunch I picked to go to the Google AJAX APIs session, and this is where I thought I made my mistake during the day, the session wasn&#8217;t bad over all, but it was the only session I went to during the day that didn&#8217;t announce anything new, and everything it did talk about, I had already worked with so I didn&#8217;t learn anything new during this session. The AJAX Search and AJAX Feed APIs are fantastic APIs put out by google that allow you to embed searches and RSS and atom feeds on web pages with very little programming.</p>

<p>The Feed API is particularly impressive, as it is one of the only free ways I&#8217;ve seen to embed any RSS or AJAX feed in any web page without any server side component, the way they got around the cross site scripting locks on javascript is astounding. But as I said, I knew all of this way before Google Developer Day, and so this session was not particularly interesting to me.</p>

<p><amp-youtube data-videoid="AXgFj_3I_80" layout="responsive" width="480" height="360"></amp-youtube></p>

<p>I should have gone to the session &#8220;A Computing System for the World&#8217;s Information: A Look Behind the Scenes at Google&#8221; instead, which I heard was a fantastic session. Fortunately for me, like the rest of the sessions at GDD07, the video is up on YouTube.</p>

<p><amp-youtube data-videoid="TQKs27Yqg-8" layout="responsive" width="480" height="360"></amp-youtube></p>

<p>The next session I went to was <strong>New Features in Maps API</strong> and a few of the new announcements in this session more then made up for the disappointment of the previous session. I have done a lot with the Google Maps API in the two years since it has been announced, and there is one thing in particular that I and many of the other people have worked with the Google Maps API have long wished would be added.</p>

<p>When the new Driving Directions functions were described in the session, a few of us actually broke into applause. The new Driving Directions functions not only leverage the fantastic driving directions functions from Google Maps and allow us to put driving directions on our own websites, but they do it in such a way that allows us to style, change, manipulate, and work with those directions so that they can fit in with the style of a site. I&#8217;ve already thought of a way to use it on a few sites to apply a simple change to the last direction based on a few factors to make the directions even better.</p>

<p>One of the things that has always been lacking on those driving directions is most of them don&#8217;t bother to tell you which side of the street the address you are looking for is. Well thanks to this API we can now make better directions by substituting the text of the last direction with text that is more specific, imagine changing the simple &#8220;End at 123 Tester&#8217;s Lane&#8221; to &#8220;123 Tester&#8217;s Lane is the 3rd building on the left, use the 2nd parking lot entrance you find, we are on the 3rd floor, room 208&#8221;, much better directions!</p>

<p>The other enhancement they announced was the Traffic overlays, introduced in google maps a few months ago, you can now add the traffic overlays into your google maps api on your own site if you wish. What will be cool is if they ever add in the ability to mesh that up with the previous api to provide alternate driving directions if someone is wanting directions right now and traffic is backed up on the route they want to take, but that will probably be a while, if ever. Watch the session, you will probably hear my audible cheers throughout the presentation.</p>

<p><amp-youtube data-videoid="0wmfBiGv1t8" layout="responsive" width="480" height="360"></amp-youtube></p>

<p>Believe it or not, even after our big lunch earlier, 2 hours later I was a tiny bit hungry, fortunately for me, Google provided a 30 minute snack break at this time, featuring fruit trays, and big warm soft pretzels to snack on, after a pretzel and some fruit and a bottle of water I was ready for another session.</p>

<p>In the 3:30 to 4:30 hour session I decided to go to the <strong>Special Session: Making Maps Mashups Discoverable with Google Mapplets</strong> session. Google Mapplets is one of the 3 new products I mentioned they were focusing the developer day on, and it&#8217;s every bit as cool as Google Gears, in fact, it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m actually going to implement on an important project I&#8217;m working on. Google Mapplets are simply a combination of the Google Gadgets API (used to make elements for the iGoogle personalized home page), and the Google Maps API (that I just mentioned). Mapplets allow you to take your Maps API applications and convert them into a format that can be Added to maps.google.com.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a bit hard to describe (though if you watch either the keynote or this session you&#8217;ll understand soon enough) but it&#8217;s a way to do what they are calling a Mashup of Mashups. The example that they give is perhaps the best example I can come up with to explain how this works. Lets say you are looking for a place to live in Chicago. Let&#8217;s say for the sake of example that you also want a home that is close enough to the mass transit lines in Chicago that you can get around easily, and of course nobody wants to live in a place with a lot of crime.</p>

<p>ChicagoCrime.org is a popular google maps api mashup that maps places where crime has been reported in Chicago. Meanwhile Google has a Real Estate Search mashup of their own to find places to live, and finally there is a simple mashup that maps the mass transit lines in Chicago. You could go to these 3 sites separately, look for a home on the Google Real Estate Search, then check on chicagocrime.org and on the mass transit map to see if the home you like is far enough away from crime, but close to mass transit, but this is complicated, and no one of those 3 sites allows you to see the data from the other two, each is special in it&#8217;s own way.</p>

<p>Enter Google Mapplets. Google Mapplets lets you map the crime points from chicagocrime.org, the mass transit, and the real estate search results ALL on maps.google.com at the same time, and then for good measure (if you do drive), add in the GasBuddy.com gas price reports so you won&#8217;t have to live right next to the most expensive gas station in town. Really cool, and I&#8217;m already working on converting some of my Maps mashups to Mapplets so that they can be added to maps.google.com&#8217;s mapplet directory.</p>

<p><amp-youtube data-videoid="QJIMioKRozQ" layout="responsive" width="480" height="360"></amp-youtube></p>

<p>In the final session I had another difficult decision between 3 sessions I was interested in, one was <strong>KML Search and Developing Maps mashups using KML/GeoRSS</strong>, the second was <strong>Custom Search Engine &#8211; Google Search in Your Hands</strong>, and the other was <strong>Special Session: Building Better AJAX Applications: Nuts &amp; Bolts&#8230;and Gears</strong>. I decided on the second of those sessions, and I&#8217;m glad I did.</p>

<p>Several months ago I was working with Google Custom Search Engines to create very many different Search Engines for Justia and Justia Projects. The process was slow, first starting with the online wizard, and then creating XML files to do it better. The problem, and slow down was not in the creating the XML files, I was able to create the over 2000 XML files I needed to create efficiently enough, the problem was the only way to upload these XML files to google was through an HTTP Upload form. This means it had to be done one at a time. To make matters worse, every time you uploaded an XML file, the order of the CSEs on the manage CSE page changed (as it was in order of last update) and this made making sure I uploaded them all properly a bit complicated.</p>

<p>In this session, Google announced a brand new enhancement to Google CSEs where you no longer have to create your different CSEs individually in a web based form and then upload XML files through HTTP upload, instead, now all you need is to put the URL of the xml file in the search form, and Google will do the rest. This means it&#8217;s now possible to create hundreds of thousands of different CSEs even faster, and what&#8217;s more we can now change the definition of the Custom Search Engines on the fly, creating new CSEs programmatically.</p>

<p>This is such a fantastic new feature that I got up, walked to the microphone and thanked them for doing this, it makes my job working with the CSEs tons simpler, and gives me a higher level of control then I ever had before, it also allows a ton of different enhancements. In the file you can now add an <code>&lt;Include&gt;</code> tag to include another xml file, so it&#8217;s now possible to do things like create universally global blacklists or whitelists of websites and share them with other people.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure such a service of a universal blacklist of spam sites will be available for people to include in their CSEs soon, I am even tempted to create this myself. Anyway, a great session, though I&#8217;m sure the other two were just as great. At the end of the session, they handed out yet another free t-shirt, this one with blanks to write on (a customizable t-shirt, to advertise the customizable search engine).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that after a day of great informative sessions, free food, and tons of new tools and apis for us to use to make our scripts even better then before, that Google wouldn&#8217;t be done giving to us, but Google doesn&#8217;t do things small. Following the sessions, Google provided free busses from the San Jose Convention Center to the Googleplex, and at the Googleplex they provided a free party for Google Developer Day attendees with free food, free drinks (even free beer and wine), free games to play, and even more free gifts to take home.</p>

<p>I got a Google branded Rubik&#8217;s Cube, and four really cool cups with glow-sticks built into them, so that you crack the cup on the side of a table to break the glow-sticks and then the cup glows brightly for the rest of the night. The food was carnival style, there were hot dogs, hamburgers, corn dogs, kettle corn, churros, snow cones, cotton candy, funnel cakes, and more. Inside they had pool tables, a DJ, and a whole bunch of arcade games (PacMan anyone?).</p>

<p>The above photos were mine, but I have misplaced my photos of the after party.  The following photos were not taken by me, photo credits go to <a href="http://javamagician.blogspot.com/2007/06/google-developer-day-evening-reception.html">The Java Magician</a> and <a href="https://ed.agadak.net/2007/06/google-developer-day-2007">edilee</a>, be sure to check out their posts for their opinions of Google Developer Day and the After Party.</p>

<p>I had a fantastic time networking with other developers and learning about these great new tools and apis from Google.</p>

<p>One interesting thing I thought I should point out, is that the other day when I was doing a google blogsearch to see if anyone new had said anything about Justia, I was somewhat surprised to notice that someone who had heard me stand up and thank the CSE team for the new enhancement had gone through the trouble of noting both my name and company from my name badge and mentioned me on their blog, so here&#8217;s a shoutout to James Briggs who <a href="http://www.jebriggs.com/blog/2007/05/google-developer-day-2007/">mentioned my being at GDD07</a> before I even had the chance to write this blog post myself.</p>

        <p>WizardCast Episode 3 is out, including some interesting announcements. I&#8217;ll go ahead an innumerate the announcements here, though I haven&#8217;t yet on the WizardCast website. First, we&#8217;ve expaned WizardCast into <a href="http://www.wizards.fm/">Wizards.FM, the Wizard&#8217;s Webcast Network</a> and have already recorded a few additional shows that will be coming out in addition to WizardCast, including &#8220;<em>The Looking Glass</em>&#8221; a movie review podcast where we review the latest in Fantasy and Science Fiction movies, &#8220;<em>WizFM News</em>&#8221; where we take our news segment out of WizardCast and produce it more regularly, &#8220;<em>The Witching Hour</em>&#8221; where we introduce people to fantasy and science fiction music, particularly Wizard Rock bands, and &#8220;<em>The Common Room Fire</em>&#8221; where we review Science Fiction and Fantasy Books.</p>

<p>The second, even bigger announcement is that this summer, we will be doing a Live Podcast at the Book&#8217;s Inc Laurel Village, in San Francisco the night of the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It will be tons of fun with giveaways, contests, trivia, and much more.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>I personally have never owned a TiVo box, primarily because I knew there were a number of <abbr title="Digital Video Recorder">DVR</abbr>s on the market that did not require a monthly subscription and I didn&#8217;t see the benefit to paying $12/month for something I thought I could get for a one time fee.</p>

<p>TiVo and Amazon have signed a deal recently that actually made me think twice about this policy however. As most people know, Amazon unveiled their Amazon Unbox program earlier this year to not much applause. After all iTunes has had video downloads for a while now, and it just didn&#8217;t seem to make sense to buy movies from Amazon when I already had iTunes. Add to that the fact that Amazon Unbox does not work on a mac as their video <abbr title="Digital Rights Management">DRM</abbr> is PC Only and I didn&#8217;t give Amazon a second thought when it came to purchasing single episodes of TV shows or directly downloading movies. Similar to the reasons I previously mentioned why I didn&#8217;t give TiVo a second thought, why would I get something that would require it&#8217;s own monthly service when I could buy a cable box with DVR built in, or better yet, build a MythTV (though that requires lots of effort and is buggy).</p>

<!--more-->

<p>But then TiVo and Amazon signed a deal that I believe is mutually smart for both companies. Amazon Unbox now can be linked with your TiVo account, which means that as you are browsing the web from anywhere, (even away from home) you can purchase a movie or episode on Amazon, or even Rent a movie (something you can&#8217;t do on iTunes) and then when you come home (or turn on your TV if you already were home) you&#8217;ll find that in your Now Playing List on your TiVo, the episode or movie is already there, ready for you to watch on your TV or (in our case) Projector.</p>

<p>I decided to take the plunge and find out. I purchased a TiVo and linked my TiVo account with my Amazon account, and now I&#8217;ve learned what I&#8217;ve been missing with Both services.</p>

<p>First, may I say TiVo is amazing! I never understood why people would ever dream of buying something with a $12.50/month service fee in order to enjoy something they can get for $5/extra a month with their cable or satellite provider, however I now stand corrected. TiVo is fantastic, their link with online features for example is something no other DVR seems to have (except for MythTV, which I previously explained is expensive). It&#8217;s fun to watch video Podcasts or listen to audio podcasts on my home theater system without doing complicated hookups of my computer to the system. It&#8217;s also nice when I&#8217;m at work and I realize I forgot to program the DVR to tape a program I&#8217;m interested in watching to be able to open my web browser and simply click on the program on TiVo.com, and know that my TiVo will record the program.</p>

<p>Next Amazon Unbox is pretty slick too, you can run it on computers, TiVo boxes, iPods, and other portable devices (including my own Palm Treo), next the really nice thing about Amazon Unbox, is while you can only have it on 2 computers or devices at the same time, you can have any number of computers and devices on your account (unlike iTunes&#8217; 5 limit) and move programs from device to device easily. But the nicest thing about it, is if you delete your program, or reformat your computer, you can easily download the program again without a problem. The one thing I was worried about with the TiVo was that I&#8217;d have to delete programs I had purchased in order to have room for other programs, but I need not have worried. I purchased &#8220;Broken Bow&#8221; (episode 1 of Enterprise), watched it (in excellent quality for something downloaded, I couldn&#8217;t tell the difference between it and programs on Digital Cable), deleted it, and downloaded it again without a problem, and without having to go through any weird remote control interface, everthing was controlled from my web browser.</p>

<p>For the cons, I have already mentioned the big ones, but I&#8217;ll ennumerate them here. First with TiVo, of course there&#8217;s the $12.95/month monthly charge which kept me away from it for so long. Amazon&#8217;s biggest con is also shared by TiVo. TiVo has the TiVo to go service which allows you to download programs you&#8217;ve recorded with TiVo to your computer, palm, and other devices, but, like amazon unbox, this service does not work on Mac, at least not yet. Let&#8217;s hope that both companies release Mac versions of their software soon. I can however load it up just fine in Parallels, so it&#8217;s not that big of a deal. Amazon also has another disadvantage in that not all amazon unbox programs are available on TiVo. For example, while Enterprise is available, Smallville was available on unbox but not on TiVo. Also the TiVo connection is very new, it could just be that I had just gotten the TiVo, but the first 2 times I attempted to download my Amazon purchased content to the TiVo it didn&#8217;t work, and I had to try again. The second episode I purchased downloaded successfully on the first try, so as I said, it could have just been because the TiVo was new.</p>

<p>Sufficient to say I love my new TiVo, and I love Amazon Unbox. If you have a TiVo, try Amazon Unbox by clicking the banner above, if you don&#8217;t have a TiVo yet, you can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/TiVo-TCD649080-Series2-Dual-Tuner-Recorder/dp/B000ER5G58%3FSubscriptionId%3D1XFK01HK9NZWGPENWGG2%26tag%3Dnickdotpro-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000ER5G58">get one at amazon.com as well</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Amazon has updated Amazon Unbox so it is now possible to watch the videos on Macs as well. As part of this update, Amazon has renamed Amazon Unbox to Amazon Video-on-Demand.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;ve long been disillusioned with Viacom and it&#8217;s child companies, especially after CBS/UPN canceled such great shows as Enterprise and Joan of Arcadia, despite massive Fan support. Today, Viacom proves yet again that it doesn&#8217;t care about the interest of it&#8217;s viewers, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/viacom-sues-youtube-google-for-1b/">Viacom has filed a lawsuit</a> against Google for $1 billion dollars.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The story goes, that according to Viacom, over a hundred thousand Viacom copyrighted materials have been viewed on Google owned YouTube over a million and a half times. The problem with Viacom&#8217;s claim though is that they believe it is Google&#8217;s fault for allowing the clips to be uploaded in the first place. YouTube wouldn&#8217;t work if it weren&#8217;t for allowing clips to be uploaded, and YouTube has long had a <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=58127">mechanism in place</a> where if a copyright owner complains, they will pull down the copyrighted content quickly.</p>

<p>I decided to look up the lawsuit to see the information on this suit is available. I did a <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/search?query=Viacom">Search for Viacom</a> on <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/">Justia Federal Court Filings and Dockets</a>, and found <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/new-york/nysdce/1:2007cv02103/302164">Viacom International, Inc. et al v.

        <p>Perhaps the most controversial aspect of this year&#8217;s MacWorld Conference and Expo, which my wife and I got to attend, was not the announcement of the iPhone, but the lack of the phrase &#8220;And now, one more thing&#8221; which has been Steve Jobs&#8217; catch phrase at his keynotes for quite some time now. Since Jobs didn&#8217;t use it this year, I&#8217;m going to shamelessly steal the phrase for the day and say &#8220;And Now, one more thing from Justia&#8221;. I mentioned <a href="2007-02-16-justia-dockets">previously</a>, that I was already working on the next project after Dockets and that Justia would be announcing it soon. My boss announced it today on a legal mailing list, so now I can finally talk about <a href="https://regulations.justia.com/">Justia Regulation Tracker</a> at <a href="http://www.regulationtracker.com/">RegulationTracker.com</a>!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Ok, for those of you, who, like me before I worked on this project, have no idea what the Federal Register is, the Federal Government passes a number of regulations every single day, four times a year chunks of these regulations get imported into something called the &#8220;Code of Federal Regulations&#8221;, but in the meantime, they are published daily as the <strong>Federal Register</strong>.</p>

<p>The problem with the Federal Register, is that while there is an online version, and you can search through past copies of the register, there are hundreds of distinct Agencies and Departments that put out regulations, and if you are interested in getting all new regulations in an agency of your choice, you are resigned to read the somewhat confusingly laid out federal register every day, and if there were no new regulations in the agency you are interested in, then you&#8217;ve wasted your time.</p>

<p>This is where Regulation Tracker comes in. If an Environmental Lawyer wants to stay ahead of the game when it comes to regulations from the EPA, with Justia&#8217;s new site, that lawyer can <a href="https://regulations.justia.com/regulations/fedreg/agencies/environmental-protection-agency/">view a list</a> of the most recent documents filed by the EPA, and if they aren&#8217;t interested in Notices, just Rules and Proposed Rules, they can view <a href="https://regulations.justia.com/regulations/fedreg?rule=yes&amp;proposed_rule=yes&amp;prev=500-300-900-600-200-100">that list</a>, and if they want to be sure they never miss an EPA filing again, they can <a href="https://regulations.justia.com/regulations/fedreg/agencies/environmental-protection-agency?limit=200&amp;mode=atom">subscribe to an RSS feed</a> so they will be constantly updated.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s more, is not only have we downloaded and parsed the Confusing Federal Register Table of Contents and turned it into a <a href="https://regulations.justia.com/regulations/fedreg/2007/03/06">Browseable and easily filtered Database</a>, but we&#8217;ve also downloaded all of the individual documents since 2005, parsed them all, and added Full Text search capabilities, so that you can search for words in any document posted in the Federal Register.</p>

<p>To find out more about Justia Regulation Tracker, check out <a href="https://lawblog.justia.com/2007/03/09/justia-regulation-tracker-beta-tracking-federal-regulations-rules-proposed-rules-and-notices/">this post</a> on Justia&#8217;s Legal Marketing Blog, or just visit <a href="https://regulations.justia.com/">RegulationTracker.com</a> and check it out for yourself.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m once again really proud to have been able to be a part of such a great project and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how people review it. I&#8217;ve also been working hard on improving the <a href="http://dockets.justia.com/">Federal Dockets Project</a> I <a href="2007-02-16-justia-dockets">previously mentioned</a>. Now we fetch even more data then before and have found a more reliable source to update it more frequently. I enjoy going to the dockets page throughout the day just to see the number of dockets growing every single hour. We also now have more information then before, including the Cause of Action, and the Presiding and Referring Judge of the case, as well as if a jury was demanded on the case and if so, by whom. Now that this project has grown more stable, Justia has issued a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070306006003/en/Justia-Launches-Free-Federal-District-Court-Filings">press release</a> to officially announce Justia Federal Court Filings &amp; Dockets.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;m really excited about a new project I have been working on for my job. <a href="http://dockets.justia.com/">Justia Federal District Court Filings and Dockets</a> is a new project I have had the pleasure of working on for Justia (the company I work for). This project is a database of all of the civil cases filed in federal district courts since the beginning of 2006, updated daily, and what&#8217;s truly great about it is that you can get RSS feeds of various methods of filtering the database. You can filter it by category, state, individual court, party name, or any combination of those filters, and then subscribe to an RSS feed for your filtered results.</p>

<p>For example you can get a listing of all cases filed by or against <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/search?query=Apple+Inc.&amp;min-day=1&amp;min-month=1&amp;min-year=2006&amp;max-day=15&amp;max-month=2&amp;max-year=2007">Apple</a> to track everyone who is suing them over the iPhone, then when you find a particular case you want more information about (like the <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/california/candce/3:2007cv00198/187974">Cisco Systems, Inc. v. Apple Inc.</a> case of January 10th, 2007 (lawsuit over the trademark on the name iPhone), you can pull up a page with <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/california/candce/3:2007cv00198/187974">information</a> about the case, including quick search links to search for the parties in a variety of different search engines, and a link to download all the case dockets on PACER (PACER is a service of the us courts system, and charges $0.08 per page). More interesting features are coming soon on Justia Federal District Court Filings and Dockets, but the project is yet another amazing free legal resource that I&#8217;ve worked on in my time here at Justia.</p>

<p>I may be a bit biased as far as my affinity for the project, considering how hard I worked on it, but I&#8217;m not the only one who is excited about it. <a href="https://blawgsearch.justia.com/search?query=justia+dockets" title="Justia BlawgSearch: Search Results for Justia Dockets">Try searching blawgsearch for &#8220;justia dockets&#8221;</a> to see just how many people are praising this fine new service of Justia.</p>

<p>Stay tuned next week for an announcement of yet another really cool project I&#8217;ve been working on with them.</p>

<p>In other news, as I want to push this site further toward some of the things I am doing professionally, you can now access this site at <a href="https://www.nick.pro/">nick.pro</a>. I may redesign the site layout to fit more in this new scheme, or I may not, but for now it&#8217;s cool to know that my blog is available at <a href="https://www.nick.pro/">www.nick.pro</a> (<em>special thanks to my boss for arranging this new highly professional domain name for me</em>).</p>

        <p>I&#8217;ve been bedridden for days with the flu and it&#8217;s driving me bonkers. A few years ago I would occasionally watch the show <em>Even Stevens</em> on the Disney Channel and I&#8217;m reminded of the episode entitled &#8220;<em>Influenza, the Musical</em>&#8221; as I lay in my bed coughing. At least everyone around me doesn&#8217;t spontaneously break into song for no reason.</p>

<p>Oh how I hope this flu goes away soon.</p>

In other news, after listening to this week&#8217;s episode of MacBreak Weekly, I&#8217;ve started messing around with Twitter. I installed a wordpress plugin that should automatically update my Twitter page whenever I&#8217;m working on a Blog post, which is in a way a bit frightening, cause that means that you all can now know when I&#8217;m blogging.  Also, it was noted to me recently that my title tags were broken on all my posts, I have repaired this now, and so my title tags should indicate what post you are actually reading.</p>

        <p>Every New Years Eve I find myself counting down the seconds until the next year hoping in my heart that the next year is better then the last. This year however I found New Years Eve very odd, because I cannot possibly imagine 2007 being as amazing as 2006 was, and I don&#8217;t even want 2007 to be better then 2006, I just want it to be more of the same.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>One year ago, on New Years Eve, 2005 I came closer then I ever had before to attending a New Years Eve party. My brother, his girlfriend (now Fiance), a friend of hers, and a friend of David&#8217;s came over to my parent&#8217;s home and the 5 of us had a little New Years Eve party. I had fun playing the part of bartender and mixing martinis and Pina Colladas for the partygoers and then as Midnight approached we all counted down the seconds until 2006. When 2006 hit, we all shouted &#8220;Happy New Year&#8221; and popped our noisemakers, and David and Hannah kissed, and I kissed&#8230; nobody. As 2005 ended I once again, as I had year after year before, silently wishing that 2006 would be better then 2005. The only difference is, this time my wish was granted.</p>

<p>That night shortly after midnight I called Barbara, who was already a big part of my life and wished her a happy new year. January, 2006 saw me return to College and I once again tried out to be in the school play, this time Rumors, by Neil Simon. Again I got a part and I worked hard at rehearsals to be the best Ken Gorman I can be.</p>

<p>The play was at the end of February, in early February I flew to Fort Smith, Arkansas where I met Barbara in person for the first time, as well as her family. That afternoon she flew back with me to Texas and she stayed with my family for the next month. For the first time in my life I got to spend Valentines Day with someone special to me. Before, every time Valentines Day came around I was either not in a relationship, or was in one but my girlfriend was far away. Barbara stayed long enough to see me perform in the play. It was wonderful to look out in the audience when I took my bow during the curtain call and see her applauding.</p>

<p>Compared to her constant presence through the month of February, March was lonely as she had returned home. In fact it was so lonely that near the end of March I invited her to return. She did and we enjoyed each other&#8217;s company going on dates to movies and Six Flags.</p>

<p>April and May are said to be months of rain, and metaphorically this was true for me as well. Both the company I was working for, and a few of the companies I consulted for were starting to need my services less and less, and I started searching in earnest for a new job elsewhere. May was bad for Barbara too, she was driving hours every day to and from a hospital where her Grandfather was in poor condition. This was not very good for me either as I was constantly worried about her driving over those mountains without any means of communicating if anything happened to her. I realized that even though I had known her a relatively short while that I loved her more then life itself, and so as the month of May came to a close I made two relatively large purchases, a new cell phone for her so that she could stay in contact with me, and an engagement ring.</p>

<p>Barbara&#8217;s grandfather passed away on June 2nd, and as his wishes were to be buried in Texas, Barbara came down to my house and I drove her to the funeral and the wake afterward. It was the worst place to do this, but I knew it would be a while before I would have the opportunity to see her father face to face again, so while at the wake after the funeral, I took Barbara&#8217;s father aside and asked for his blessing to ask Barbara to be my wife.</p>

<p><amp-img title="Wedding Photo 2" alt="Wedding Photo 2" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2007/01/141_6538339187_7847_n.webp" width="604" height="458" layout="responsive" lightbox>
  <amp-img fallback title="Wedding Photo 2" alt="Wedding Photo 2" src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2007/01/141_6538339187_7847_n.jpg" width="604" height="458" layout="responsive" lightbox></amp-img>
</amp-img></p>

<p>The rest of June was full of preparations. Because many of the jobs I applied for were out of Texas, we decided it would be better to get married sooner rather then later. And because July 2nd was Barbara&#8217;s grandparents&#8217; anniversary, we felt that it would be a great way to honor Barbara&#8217;s grandfather to be married on their anniversary. We had a beautiful, small ceremony in my parent&#8217;s home (it&#8217;s amazing how well the living room was transformed into a chapel).</p>

<p>Following the wedding we had a wonderful honeymoon in Vegas. Once married I focused on working and trying to find a new job. In August I got my opportunity. The same <a href="http://danilo.ariadoss.com/">friend</a> who ran the <a href="http://www.hogwartslive.com/">website</a> where Barbara and I met, also happened to have an uncle who owned a company in Silicon Valley. He suggested I send his uncle my Resume, and the next thing I knew Barbara and I were moving half way across the country to Mountain View, California.</p>

<p>These last few months in California have been very busy, but it is clear that my life has taken a definite turn towards the better. I love my new job and my new home near the California Coast. In November Barbara and I drove down to Los Angeles to spend Thanksgiving with my family at my aunt&#8217;s house. Christmas was spent at our new home in Mountain View, we decided we wanted to be at our own home for our first Christmas together. Christmas Dinner however we enjoyed with my boss and his wife.</p>

<p>We spent the week following Christmas wondering what we were going to do for New Years, wondering that is, until we got a phone call from <a href="http://www.goosite.net/">Mike</a> on December 29th. He and his family were traveling south along the California Coastline taking the long route back to Phoenix from Seattle. They were going to stop on the 30th in San Simeon, CA near Hearst Castle. Barbara and I thought that seeing a famous castle sounded like a great way to end 2006 so we hopped in our van and started driving down Route 1 towards San Simeon. We met up with Mike and his family and on New Years Eve day we toured the castle with him and his family. That evening we threw an impromptu party in our hotel room with Sparkling Cider and some home-made pumpkin pies that Barbara and I baked the night before.</p>

<p>So as midnight approached the 8 of us were playing monopoly and scene-it and eating pie and laughing, and I realized that I was no longer coming close to going to a new years eve party, I was at one. As midnight ticked closer we told our new-years resolutions, lifted our cups of sparkling cider and counted down out-loud the seconds, &#8220;10!&#8221;, I looked around at the smiling faces laughing as they counted, &#8220;9!&#8221; I laughed along, &#8220;8! 7! 6! 5!&#8221; at 5 seconds my eye caught Barbara&#8217;s, and there was a sparkle there that caused the entire year to flash before my eyes, the year raced forward, the ups and the downs until it reached the moment that I was standing on the faux-hard wood floor of the family room of my parent&#8217;s home. And in that second I was once again standing in my new suit next to Pastor Tom and looking across the family room made into a chapel at the kitchen. That sparkle I saw in my wife&#8217;s eye in that second matched the sparkle I saw in her eye as I saw her in her wedding dress for the first moment.</p>

<p>2006 was such a wonderful year, but I will always remember 3 moments, 3 separated seconds out of that year. The first moment, was the sparkle in Barbara&#8217;s eye behind her veil at our wedding when she came into view. A sparkle that, when matched with the view of her in her wedding dress was enough to freeze time and nearly stop my heart. The 3rd of those 3 moments, was that same sparkle, the same sparkle in her eye, in a hotel room, on New Years Eve, 5 seconds before 2007 arrived. I shall leave your imaginations to decide what the second of the 3 moments was, as I shall keep that moment to myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;4! 3! 2!&#8221; and I realized, every year before this I spent these last couple seconds wishing beyond wish, hoping beyond hope, praying with all my heart that the next year would be better then the last, but this time, I wasn&#8217;t. 2 Seconds left of 2006 and all I wanted was for those seconds to go on forever, I wasn&#8217;t ready to let such a wonderful year come to a close. &#8220;1&#8230;&#8221; but does it really have to? 2006 was incredible, and I am really looking forward to what is in store for me in 2007.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy New Year!&#8221; I hope that your 2007 will be wonderful. Here&#8217;s to 2006!</p>

        <p>My last blog post before this one was in August and things have definitely changed in the lives of Barbara and I since then. The biggest change (really the only change but it has effected so much of my life it&#8217;s really a category rather then an item) is that I got a new job. I now work as a programmer for <a href="http://www.justia.com/" title="Justia Inc.">Justia Inc</a>. Justia is a company that, among other things, provides websites for lawyers and law firms. The company is based in Palo Alto, California (in Silicon Valley).</p>

<p>As such this change of a new job also means that we no longer live with my parents in Texas but are now Californians. We have a small, one bedroom apartment in Mountain View, California a few minutes drive from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googleplex">Googleplex</a>.</p>

<p>Those of you who know us best most likely know this by now, but I felt it was important to update my blog and let people know about these changes. Yesterday (December 18th) marked the 2 month (October 18th) anniversary of the day we moved into our new home here in California.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>How do I like my new job? I have never been more content in working then I am now. Justia is a fantastic place to work and I am at once enjoying the work I get to do as well as enjoying my new life in California.</p>

<p>Justia has an interesting business model and seems to be focused primarily on offering fantastic services to the legal community, not only in the paid services, but in the little services they are offering to the community for free. I have spent a good deal of my time since arriving here working on a project known as <a href="http://www.blawgsearch.com/">BlawgSearch</a> and it&#8217;s sister site <a href="http://www.blawgs.fm/">Blawgs.FM</a>.</p>

<p>BlawgSearch (<em>Blawg</em> is yet another web contraction, as Blog stands for We<strong>b log</strong>, Blawg replaces the <em>lo</em> from blog with <em>law</em> indicating that a Blawg is a <strong>Law B</strong>lo<strong>g</strong>, or I suppose, We<strong>b law</strong> lo<strong>g</strong> to be precise) is a website that indexes all of the posts of tons of legal blogs and allows users to do relevancy based full text searches across them. Similarly, Blawgs.FM extends this service to Podcasts by allowing those searches to be restricted to posts that contain multimedia attachments. Both sites also feature a powerful directory of blawgs and blawgcasts (legal podcasts). The project has been great fun to work on and I&#8217;m proud of how my work is being used to offer a fantastic free tool to the internet community. For more information about BlawgSearch and Blawgs.FM, check out <a href="https://onward.justia.com/2006/12/13/blawgsearch-com-blawgs-fm-new-legal-blog-search-tools-from-justia/">this post</a> from Justia&#8217;s owner (my boss) Tim Stanley, or just visit <a href="https://blawgsearch.justia.com">the site</a> and try out these powerful search tools for yourself.</p>

<p>Justia has been fantastic to Barbara and I from the very beginning. First they hired me to work from Texas on a consultant basis so they could try out my programming abilities. After a little over a month of working for them on this trial basis they paid to fly both Barbara and I to California to meet them and while we were here offered me a full time position. A very short time later (a week and a half) Barbara and I were on the road driving to California to move into our new apartment with a van full of everything we own.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an odd journey home for me, I was born in California and spent the first two-fifths of my life here. While I was in Southern California in my young life, I now find myself in the heart of Silicon Valley. After spending all my life as someone who lives for technology I find myself in the most technological area of the nation.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s something else really cool that just happened here at Justia today, but I&#8217;m going to wait until Justia has had time to announce it officially themselves before I mention it in my own blog.</p>

        <p>Most of you know by now know that I was married on July 2nd, 2006 in a small ceremony in my home. For those of you who do not know this&#8230; I was married on July 2nd, 2006 in a small ceremony in my home. The question that a lot of you seem to have though is, why haven&#8217;t I posted anything about this wedding yet. The truth is I have. Barbara and I setup a special separate blog for the wedding which can be found at molinefamily.info.</p>

<p>As many of you also know, it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted here on this blog, mostly because I&#8217;ve been busy with work, and getting ready for this wedding. Then after the wedding there was the honeymoon (a wonderful week in Vegas), followed by a week and a half of hard work. So I apologize for the long time it&#8217;s taken to get this post about the happiest day of my life up. For more information about the wedding and honeymoon, visit molinefamily.info to read the blog entries posted by both Barbara and myself. Yesterday I uploaded the pictures of the wedding to my photo gallery. Click the picture of Barbara and I to the left to see the full photo album.</p>

        <p>I am applying for a job in Colorado Springs with the C&amp;MA and they require with job applications that you send in a copy of your testimony. As this seems to me to be a good thing to keep a record of and I have never taken the opportunity to write out my testimony before, I thought that I should post a copy of my testimony here so that I can always get it back later, and so that anyone else who cares to read my testimony can read it as well.</p>

<!--more-->

<hr />

<p>For many years I struggled when it came to thinking about my testimony. In today&#8217;s Christian society you rarely hear of a testimony that is shared that does not involve some sort of radical conversion or some falling away and returning to Christ, mostly because those are the testimonies that people share in the more public forums. So I have struggled with my testimony because it doesn&#8217;t include anything of the sort, I always thought that my testimony was just not strong enough to share. I admit, there are times when I&#8217;ve even thought to myself &#8220;I should fall away for a while, let the sinful nature take over, so that when I come back to Christ I can have a better testimony.&#8221; No doubt this was the devil&#8217;s attempt to entice me away from the Lord, in hopes that I would not return later, but my love for the Lord always fought back against that voice. I love the Lord with all my heart, and have no desire whatsoever to fall away from Him.</p>

<p>I was saved when I was 4 years old (in the spring of 1987, though sadly neither I nor my father, who led me to Christ kept track of the exact date) and I can honestly say there has never been a time in my life when I haven&#8217;t wanted to serve the Lord. I was baptized in the summer of 1991 at the Calvary Chapel Family Camp in California.</p>

<p>This testimony seems somewhat weak at first glance, as I don&#8217;t even remember what my life was like without Christ. But when I really think about it, I can&#8217;t imagine life without the love of Jesus Christ my savior, and that is a testimony I am actually very proud of now. Jesus has graciously spared me the turmoil that I have heard in testimonies all my life.</p>

<p>My testimony of service and of what the Lord has done for me in my life is a little more extensive. As early as I was able, I began volunteering at the various churches I&#8217;ve attended, starting with joining the setup and teardown crew at the age of 8 at Long Beach Grace Brethren Church in Long Beach, California, for their Saturday Evening services. I continued serving with this ministry until my family moved to Virginia. My family attended a local Baptist Church (Leesburg Baptist Church) for a time before we moved to Cornerstone Chapel (a Calvary Chapel affiliate church in Leesburg, Virginia). At the time we started attending Cornerstone, it met in a local middle school, but eventually it moved to it&#8217;s own building, and once there I volunteered to be a part of the overhead ministry, moving the transparencies on the overhead projectors so that the congregation could read them during worship.</p>

<p>Around this time I started attending Leesburg Christian School, and this is where I think God twice allowed seemingly very negative things to happen to me, in order to influence me. First of all I didn&#8217;t start going to LCS, I started going to Simpson Middle School, the very same public Middle School that Cornerstone Chapel met in. I did not do well at Simpson, and found myself physically assaulted by other teenagers on a daily basis. Eventually the black eyes added up to the point that I had to be taken out of the school. My mom took a job as a school bus driver for LCS in order to pay my tuition for me to attend school in a Christian environment, and this had a tremendous impact on my life. At LCS God led me to mentors who helped to guide me in my Christian Walk, as well as move me closer towards my eventual goal of working with computers. The school had a small computer lab that I spent a great deal of my spare time in.</p>

<p>Eventually my mom could no longer stay as a bus driver because she needed to take a job that would not allow her to drive a school bus every morning and evening, and I was told that I would have to be returning to public school simply because the family could not afford to pay for my tuition at the school. I had already heard of a magnet high school, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, and applied to attend there, feeling that it would help me towards my goal of working with Computers and that a school filled with other students that liked Science, Math, and Technology would be less likely to be filled with the bullies that flocked normal Public High Schools. I was really excited and hopeful when it came to applying for that school, and I felt certain that it was what was best for me. God however knew differently. I was not accepted to TJHS, and it devastated me.</p>

<p>LCS&#8217;s school administration however felt that I should remain there, despite my family not being able to afford to pay for my tuition, so instead they offered me an opportunity. If I worked after school and during free periods in their school computer lab, and office, and if I attended their summer camps and worked the Computer Lab then too, I could continue to attend Leesburg Christian free of tuition. This turned out to be a tremendous blessing over the next few years, as God instilled in me early a sense of responsibility in earning my way through school, as well as blessing me with the opportunity to surround myself with spiritual mentors who brought me closer to the Lord.</p>

<p>When my family moved to Texas, we started going to Eden Road Community Church in Arlington, TX. ERCC is a C&amp;MA church, and it had been the first time I had ever heard of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, but what I&#8217;ve come to know of the Alliance since then has been a tremendous blessing to me. I quickly got involved in the overhead ministry at ERCC just as I had been at Cornerstone Chapel, and I also volunteered to setup and launch the church&#8217;s website edenroad.com. Not long afterward I got involved in the Audio/Video ministry at the church and continue running Sound and or Video for the church to this day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile ERCC was my introduction into not only the Christian and Missionary Alliance but more specifically the Southwestern District. I was able to meet with and work with various members of the District over the last few years. I accepted a consulting job managing the Computer Network at the district office and have been maintaining it for the last few years. Also I have gone with the District to the last several Southwestern District Conferences where I have had the opportunity and privilege of getting to know the other Pastors in the Southwestern District, as well as having the joy of meeting such visitors as former Alliance President Dr. Peter Nanfelt and current President Dr. Gary Benedict, and have been blessed to learn from the teachings of them and others during the worship services at those Conferences.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest influence of my being involved in the Southwestern District however has been how blessed I have been to get to know Dan and Iris Wetzel the former District Superintendent of the Southwestern District and his wife. During the time I worked with the Southwestern District I have considered myself truly privileged to get to know them and learn from their years of experience and their love and knowledge of the Lord. In fact it was Rev. Wetzel who finally helped me to understand that just because I didn&#8217;t have a radical conversion in my past, doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t have a testimony of my life with Christ to Share.</p>

<p>The Lord has truly blessed me in my life. While I may not always see it or appreciate it as much as I should, the Lord has guided my steps since before I can even remember, and will continue to guide my steps the rest of my days.</p>

        <p>This is a retroactive post, in May, I had a horrific experience where I almost died from a combination ailment and car accident. While working late at the Want a Better Website offices, I started experiencing great pain, I believe now that I was passing a kidney stone. I decided at 4:30 a.m. that I should drive home. While driving, I had a car accident, as another symptom of the ailment (a sudden need to vomit without warning) caused me to swerve, hitting the curb and destroying both left tires of the car, not to mention bending the front struts in the impact with the ground. I was hurt, but not more badly then my gut was already feeling.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The car was in pretty bad shape, but thanks to the generosity of the Eden Road Community Church Compassion Team, my car was repaired, even though I could not afford to pay for the repairs myself.</p>

<p>But that is the &#8220;almost another&#8221; mentioned in this post, the actual Funeral I am mentioning is that of Barbara, my fiance&#8217;s grandfather. I attended the funeral with her in Northeast Texas, it was a very sad day.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;m on a roll with installations of WP Blogs, I&#8217;ve now set one up for <a href="http://www.barbara.pro/">my girlfriend</a> so that she has a site of her own. It&#8217;s a simple header/footer, though I think she&#8217;ll like it. I&#8217;ll have to come up with a better background color then the blue/black gradient, It doesn&#8217;t mesh well with the rose. Still, I&#8217;ve been having a good time with them.

        <p>Friday the 5th of May was a very busy day. It began by driving my girlfriend to the airport so she could go home. She had to take a very early flight in order to make it home because later flights were filling up fast. I then went from the airport directly to work where I worked a long and full day. From the office I had to drive home as quickly as possible because I had to throw my stuff into my bag to go with the family back to the airport to fly to Illinois so that we could drive up to Wisconsin on Saturday to attend my sister&#8217;s wedding.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The Wedding itself was nice. It was in a lovely little chapel next to a mansion on the coast of the lake in Kenosha, WI. It was a very touching ceremony and it was quite good to see Steph and Zachary and Laurel again.</p>

<p>There was a bit of empty time between the Wedding and the Reception so we met up with some friends of ours who had moved up to Wisconsin a year or so ago. It was nice to see the Cantleberrys again. We had a brief lunch with them at Applebees in Kenosha and took this picture of all of us. It was nice to catch up with them, though we were sad to hear that Jim Cantleberry has lost his job recently. Please pray for him that he would find another job soon (especially if you are one of those lucky people who has the privilege of knowing him and his family).</p>

<p>After our fun with the Cantleberry&#8217;s we found our way to the reception. I&#8217;ve been to a few wedding receptions now since I&#8217;ve come &#8220;of age,&#8221; but this is the first wedding reception I&#8217;ve been to since I&#8217;ve reached the magic 21 that actually had alcohol at the reception. The party itself was fun. It was very entertaining to see some of the dancing, particularly my parents swing dancing, Zach and Laurel dancing, Dad dancing with Steph, and more of Zach Dancing (see above). Z is quite the character and watching him enjoy himself on the dance floor was a real treat.</p>

<p>There were 3 things about the reception I want to write down here because I want to remember them as good ideas for a wedding reception.</p>

<p>The first was a photo backdrop area where pictures could be taken of people who attended the wedding. This particular picture was not taken by the Wedding Photographer, it was taken on our camera, but Dad and Mom did get a photo in front of the backdrop for Steph&#8217;s wedding album.</p>

<p>The second good idea was that there were a couple kids tables with hoola-hoops, crayons and play-dough for the kids to hang-out at. The kids didn&#8217;t get quite so bored of the party and they didn&#8217;t cause a distraction to the adults.</p>

<p>The third was related to the second. The kids had their own food-line. The reception was a buffet but the kids had their own buffet line with Chicken Tenders and French Fries. This served a dual purpose. First, it gave the kids something else to eat other then what the adults were eating (and thus reduced any complaints about the food from them), and second it again kept the kids from getting bored or tired of waiting as they had their own much shorter line to get food at.</p>

<p>Be sure to --click any of the pictures in this article to get to the photo gallery because there are just far too many pictures to actually put in this blog entry--.</p>

<p>Late, late Saturday night we drove back to Chicago, and then got less then 2 hours sleep before heading to the airport to catch a very early flight home. It was definitely a tiring but fun weekend.</p>

        <p>Well all my work on Cap&#8217;s Log has inspired me to do some more image editing. I have now created a new version of the Arcadia Station website. Check out the difference between the <a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060326012421/http://arcadia.stations.acalltoduty.com/">old version</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060521124319/http://arcadia.stations.acalltoduty.com/">new version</a>.  I guess I just got tired of the site that represented the station I am SM for not having any information.  I&#8217;m really pleased with the results.</p>

        <p>My how time flies. I went to my blog today and noticed, low and behold, that I hadn&#8217;t updated it in over a year (15 months to be more exact) and a lot certainly has happened in that year. With this new post I have also replaced my old blogging software (I was never quite happy with Blog:CMS) with WordPress, which I was reluctant to try, but now I find it to be such a good blogging software that I have no idea what I had against it for so long.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>First of all, the play I mentioned in a <a href="2005-01-24-drama-king" title="Don't be such a Drama King">previous post</a> went on pretty well, and you can find pictures of the play in my photo gallery. While it was one of the most exhausting things I&#8217;ve ever done, acting as Roger in Musical Comedy Murders of 1940 was a blast and lit a fire within me letting me know I was far more interested in Acting then I ever dreamed I would be. So much so that this year when given the chance again, I again took the stage playing a character in a play, but more about that later.</p>

<p>The job interview I mentioned in a previous post did turn out to getting me a new job. I have for the past year been working for <a href="http://www.wantabetterwebsite.com/">Want a Better Website, Inc.</a> in Fort Worth, which is probably the primary reason I stopped writing blog entries. I have been so busy since then that I haven&#8217;t had any time whatsoever. The job is stressful and at times I don&#8217;t like it, but at other times it can be a lot of fun. In the last year I have learned PHP and now program in it almost exclusively. I&#8217;ve accomplished many interesting things in programming over the past year including learning CSS and even (more recently AJAX).</p>

<p>So much has happened over the course of the last year that I can&#8217;t even remember most of it, I suppose if I had blogged about it then, I would be able to go to the blog to read all about it. So I&#8217;ll just give you the highlights and lowlights of what has happened.</p>

<p>In May, the final episode of <em>Star Trek: Enterprise</em> aired. As I mentioned previously it was my favorite Television Series and I miss it greatly, but that&#8217;s not the reason I&#8217;m mentioning it in this blog entry. My mother and I flew to Los Angeles California and saw the finalie with Rod Roddenberry, Gene Roddenberry&#8217;s son at a party he hosted with the <em>Save Enterprise</em> people. It was a fun event, though sad to see Enterprise come to an end. It seems like so long ago, mostly because in all the time since, there has been absolutely nothing Star Trek related happening to me except for ACTD.</p>

<p>Speaking of ACTD, I don&#8217;t remember if this happened before or after I stopped writing or not, but I am now the SM (once upon a time known as AGM) of <a href="http://arcadia.stations.acalltoduty.com/">Arcadia Station</a>. It is a lot of fun to come up with plotlines for the crew members to act out, and I enjoy each week sitting down to start a new mission.</p>

</amp-img></p>

<p>In July <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0439784549/132-6113714-8782916?SubscriptionId=0P20NKJGP78BQ061KR02/132-6113714-8782916&amp;sa-no-redirect=1" title="View product details at Amazon">Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince</a> came out. Surely you are thinking, why is that something I care about enough to remember, two reasons. First of all it was a really good book, by far the best in the series and if you haven&#8217;t read it yet, then I strongly recommend you <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0439784549/132-6113714-8782916?SubscriptionId=0P20NKJGP78BQ061KR02/132-6113714-8782916&amp;sa-no-redirect=1" title="View product details at Amazon">read it</a>. The second, and far sadder reason that I am posting about the release of HBP is because I planned a trip around it&#8217;s release date. The Thursday before the release I flew to Tennessee to visit my girlfriend, the hope being that we would have a good time together and actually get a chance to read the book as well.</p>

<p>The trip could not have gone more horribly. I got there Thursday evening, and she couldn&#8217;t be bothered to see me until Friday Afternoon. But oh well right, so she wants to go to a mall over an hour&#8217;s drive away so we drive to Huntsville where she wants to go and while in the mall she didn&#8217;t want to be within 10 feet of me the entire time we were in the mall. Then we went to a movie (Batman Begins, definitely the best Batman movie ever, though that&#8217;s not really saying much as all the other Batman movies have been crap) and she completely ignored me the entire time we were in the theater. Then after we drive back she barely spends any time with me before she leaves. So at midnight that night I go down to her local Wal-Mart to buy a copy of the book. I bring it back to the hotel and read her the first chapter of it over the phone.</p>

<p>The next day, Saturday she didn&#8217;t show up at the hotel to see me until almost 8 p.m. So I had absolutely nothing to do because remember, I had no laptop. The one thing I did have was a copy of Half Blood Prince, so I did what any eager fan would do, I read it, I should say I devoured it, I loved it, it was fantastic. When she did show up (again, 8 p.m.) she got mad at me because I had read the book without her! She who was doing nothing more important then grocery shopping and couldn&#8217;t put off shopping till Sunday so that she could spend time with me, got mad at me because I read a book!</p>

<p>Sunday I called her up on the phone before I left and asked her if she wanted to meet with me before I left. I promised to treat her to breakfast, brunch, lunch, or just sitting and talking while I had a little time to kill before getting back to the airport. She told me she didn&#8217;t feel like it, so I drove back to the airport early and while I waited for my flight I continued reading the book. By the time I got home there was barely any of the book left so I read it before the normal time I called her at night to talk. She spent the next several days calling me insensitive and a jerk, eventually, sadly I had to break up with her. It was extremely expensive for me to make a trip out to see her, and she couldn&#8217;t be bothered to spend any time with me during my trip, and then got mad at me because I read a book!</p>

<p>Since then my friendship with her has been strained at best. At times she can be friendly and we can chat a little bit like old times before we got into a relationship, but at other times she can be violent and vindictive.</p>

<p>In August I was able to scrounge up enough money to buy another laptop, rather then buying one on credit (we still haven&#8217;t finished paying for the old laptop) I bought one on ebay, an emachine. I swore for a long time I would never buy an emachine, but the computer has run very well considering it&#8217;s low price and has served me well since then.</p>

<p>I became a staff member on <a href="http://www.hogwartslive.com/">HogwartsLive</a>, a Harry Potter RPG running the Legend of the Green Dragon code at some point in the year and I&#8217;m glad I did, because in October I met Barbara Garcia on the site. We became friends very quickly, always making sure to chat when we had time.</p>

<p><amp-img src="https://www.nickmoline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2006/05/hpgfmov.webp" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Movie 4)" alt="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Movie 4)" width="473" height="679" layout="responsive" lightbox>

</amp-img></p>

<p>In November I travelled to Phoenix to visit my friend <a href="http://www.goosite.net/">Mike</a> (also known as MrGoo or Gooey). We saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in IMAX on the day of release with his family. It was a fun week and a half trip and a nice getaway from Texas. The movie was definitely the best of the Harry Potter movies (far better then Prisoner of Azkaban which I was mad at because it skipped the central plotline of the book!) In addition to the movie I was also introduced to an interesting new food item, Pine Burgers, which Mike&#8217;s family introduced me to. Pineapple on a burger, yum!</p>

<p>December brought the release of 2 other movies I really enjoyed, <strong>The Chronicles of Narnia, the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe</strong> and <strong>The Producers</strong>. Both movies were excellent. I had been worried about Narnia because I didn&#8217;t think Disney would be able to do the movie well, but I was wrong, Narnia was far better then I could possibly have imagined. The Producers on the other hand, was a well done musical movie that actually makes you feel like you are watching a Broadway play. December also brought 2 other things that were good. First of all my Grandma and Aunt Judy came for a visit, which it is always good to see my Grandma, and I hadn&#8217;t seen Aunt Judy in a very long time. The second was that my relationship with Barbara was building. We were fast becoming very good friends, but we could both tell that we were destined to become more. On December 27th I finally asked her to become my girlfriend and we&#8217;ve been in love ever since.</p>

<p>In January I returned to school after having taken the fall semester off (because work needed all of my attention) and immediately tried out to be in the next school play (having missed the stage ever since Musical Comedy Murders). <em>Rumors</em> by Neil Simon. I played the part of Ken Gorman, a lawyer and had a blast acting once again. One of the most interesting parts of being in the play was that I got to wear a tux for the first time in my life which was different for me.</p>

<p>The highlight of being in this play however had almost nothing to do with the play at all. 2 Saturdays before the play, I flew to Fort Smith, Arkansas in the early morning and met Barbara&#8217;s family there. Barbara then flew with me back to Texas and spent the next few weeks with me and my family and it was one of the most wonderful few weeks of my life. She saw my play a few times and spent time with me and my family. February, when the play and this visit took place will definitely be a month to remember forever.</p>

<p>She returned for another few week visit in April. We went to Six Flags together and saw a few more movies, enjoying each other&#8217;s company. April also brought a trip to Waco for the Southwestern District of the C&amp;MA District Conference. I once again attended the conference to run audio/video for it. As we&#8217;ve now reached the end of April I&#8217;ll save the events of May for followup Blog Entries (as this is an unusually long entry for me).</p>

<hr />

<p>If you aren't a musical theatre person lik eme and have been wracking your mind trying to think where you know the title of this post from, it is a lyric from the song <em>Seasons of Love</em> from <em>Rent</em></p>

<p><amp-youtube data-videoid="UvyHuse6buY" layout="responsive" width="480" height="270"></amp-youtube></p>

<p>Incidentially 525,600 minutes is a number that would be familiar to me even if I wasn't a theatre buff as software developers often have to do math based on periods of time so there are various intervals I know that I have to use from time to time.</p>

<ul>
<li>60 seconds in a minute</li>
<li>60 minutes in an hour</li>
<li>600 seconds in 10 minutes (and 300 seconds in 5 minutes)</li>
<li>3,600 seconds in an hour (and 1800 seconds in half an hour)</li>
<li>1,440 minutes in a day (720 minutes in 12 hours)</li>
<li>8,6400 seconds in a day</li>
<li>72 hours in 3 days (and 48 hours in 2)</li>
<li>604,800 seconds in a week</li>
<li>525,600 minutes in a year (or 527,040 in a leap year)</li>
</ul>

<p>These numbers come up all the time (some more often than others).</p>

        <p>I&#8217;m constantly being told I&#8217;m far too negative, that I focus too much on all the bad things in my life and not enough on the pleasures in life.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s 5:35 in the morning and I haven&#8217;t slept. In 4 hours I&#8217;m going to have to be at school ready to perform my first graded scene in Acting I class, then I will have to perform my first speech (Historical) in Public Speaking Class, then I will have to go straight to rehearsal where I&#8217;m expected to be off book, and then I will have 2 grueling classes of non-stop notetaking that will take me until 9 p.m., and of course, this is coming off of 2 weeks of some of the biggest pains in my entire life, passing a kidney stone, my favorite TV show being cancelled without any possible replacement for the first time in 18 years, and of course having my laptop being stolen. Yet in spite of all of this, I&#8217;m in a surprisingly good mood right now.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Why do you ask? Oddly enough, I&#8217;m in a good mood right now simply because I have fixed the annoying problem that has been plaguing my internet connection here at the house for the past couple weeks, and, on top of that, I just secured a job interview for tomorrow. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll get the job or not, but it&#8217;s the first real interview I&#8217;ve had in months, and it&#8217;s a start.</p>

<p>Also, I spent much of last night in a rather productive, if fun and silly, conference call between me, my girlfriend, and my business partner about the present and future of my business and my personal financial troubles. So, I am exhausted, and I have tons of work ahead of me, and tons of pain behind me, but I&#8217;m in a good mood, and that&#8217;s worth a blog entry isn&#8217;t it?</p>

        <p>I used to think that bloggers seemed to post about ridiculous amounts of suffering in their lives. Back then I assumed that this was simply due to exaggeration and making the sorrow up out of thin air. Now I have a completely new theory. Owning a blog causes suffering.</p>

<p>Anybody who has been glancing at my blog on a regular basis knows that particularly the last year of my life has been filled with suffering. Horrible things seem to keep happening to me, usually without any sort of good reason. What is the most recent horrific thing that has happened to me? Yesterday, my laptop was stolen.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Our story begins at 14:28. I was heading to my Theatre Practicum class (the class that makes it so that I get absolutely no lunch break on Thursdays), and I dropped off my belongings in the Green Room (for those of you who don't know what a green room is, it is kind of a break room next to the theatre for the actors and crewmembers who are working on a play). The room was basically empty except for a black male in baggy clothing who was sleeping on the couch that was in the room.</p>

<p>I signed into the practicum sign-in book and started my work. First I was wiring on a new plug for a lamp, and then I was working on removing some fabric from a chair that was going to be reupholstered for the play. I did not get very far on removing this fabric when one of the other actors from the play came down and pulled me out of practicum because I was needed up in rehearsal. I followed her up there and proceeded to rehearse Act II of the play for the next couple hours.</p>

<p>At 17:29 I was rushing back downstairs to get my belongings because my next class was to begin at 17:30. When I entered the Green Room I noticed that my backpack had moved. I had left it on the counter immediately to the left of the coffee pot. It had been moved to the floor next to the table, positioned between the last chair on the right hand side of the table (from the perspective of the door) and the chair at the foot of the table.</p>

<p>The zippered pouch in the rear of the bag (the pouch designated for the laptop) had been unzipped all of the way and the laptop removed from it. None of the other compartments (including the one that contained the power adaptor to charge the laptop's battery) had been removed from the backpack.</p>

<p>After fretting in the green room on the couch for a few minutes I went down the hallway to the College Police Department to file a report. The window where these type of things are normally done was closed, as apparently the reception window for the police department closes at 17:00. There was a number on the door and I called it immediately. A few minutes later the door to the right of that window opened and the Sergeant came out to take my information.</p>

<p>After taking down the general information on the case he turned it over to a Corporal. Corporal Missildine escorted me back down to the Green Room where I recounted the story for him in the presence of the Director of the play who had come down to the Green Room when she heard about my plight, and several other members of the production staff.</p>

<p>I returned down to the police station with Corporal Missildine where I submitted a written statement which the Sergeant notarized. The Corporal filed a police report and they told me I needed to get hold of the Serial Number of the laptop so they can get it entered into a national database of stolen goods as quickly as possible. I rushed home and went for the box that the laptop was shipped in. The box contained a packing slip which I then rushed back to the police station at the school.</p>

<p>The Packing slip contained the Service ID Code that was on the bottom of the laptop that I had to use every time I called Dell for any sort of Technical Support. The Police Station said that this unique code that was on the bottom of the laptop was not enough, so I called Dell and waited on hold for an hour, only to be told that the Service Tag WAS the Serial Number and now there is a number of other things I'm going to have to do with Dell as well to report the laptop Stolen.</p>

<p>Sufficient to say, yesterday was not a good day. This entry is being written from David's computer while he is away at school since I no longer have a computer I can use to post.</p>

        <p>Ok so that was one of my favorite lines from <em>Shrek 2</em>, but it is the first thing that popped into my mind as a title for this article. This past Wednesday evening I went over to my school to have some fun by trying out for a part in the upcoming play <em>The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940</em>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The Auditions took place over 2 nights, Wednesday and Thursday from 7 to whenever. There were only 4 people who showed up on Wednesday to audition including myself so I got to read a lot of parts. My last class on Tuesday/Thursday lets out at 8:20, so I decided to mosey down to the theatre to watch some of the auditions. While I was there, Pert, the director and my Acting I teacher, asked me if I could read some filler parts for her for scenes where they wanted to read certain characters and there were some filler characters in there.</p>

<p>Friday was callback auditions. Due to the relatively low number of males who auditioned, all the guys were called back, so I auditioned some more.</p>

<p>This morning I headed over to the school and checked out the bulletin board in the green room to see if I had gotten a part.</p>

<p>The Part I most wanted was that of Patrick O'Reilly, the "Irish" Tennor who turns out at the end of the play not to be Irish at all. I just love speaking with a fake Irish accent, which is what the part called for.</p>

<p>I did get a part, but not O'Reilly. Instead I got the part of Roger Hopewell. Roger is supposed to be a famous composer, with a sarcastic air. He's a great part and has a lot of great lines (and he's one that doesn't happen to die in the play), but the reason I'm not to keen on him is because I found out (after all my readings for him) that he's supposed to be gay, and I'm certainly not gay and really don't think I can pull off gay, but it's theatre, and I shall do my best.</p>

<p>It should be fun to do some acting.</p>

<p>First rehearsal is at 2:30 and it is 12:35 now, so that's just a couple hours away. But as I have not written anything in my blog of note of late, I figured this would be a nice thing to post. I'm sure to post more about this as time goes on.</p>

        <p>Tonight we had a visitor from Germany. Frank Liesen, was youth pastor of my church when I first moved here to Texas. He left when he felt called to Germany where he&#8217;s lived for the last 5 years is in town on Furlough. He and his wife and new baby came over to visit with us for dinner. I took this picture of him with my cell phone to illustrate the blog. Not a very clear picture, but I took it in a hurry.</p>

On the other hand, I have not received word that they believe me from the DA&#8217;s office yet either. They did receive my letter. I sent it certified mail and they received it on Tuesday according to the USPS, but no word back from them in any form that they believe my story, and no word that they are after the real culprits of this crime. I guess now all I can do is wait.</p>

        <p>As most of you who know me well know, I&#8217;ve had a great deal of difficulty lately with the fact that some checks from a long time closed checking account have gotten into the hands of some vagrants who have decided to go on a several month shopping spree in my name. Last thursday I received a letter from the Tarrant County DA(District Attorney) office stating that if I didn&#8217;t pay off the balance of 6 of those checks within 10 days a warrant would be put out for my arrest.</p>

<p>What follows is the events of Thursday through today in regards to what has happened thusfar in this case.</p>

<p>Friday I left the house with my father. We went first down to the Police Station. There I wanted to check on the police report I filed on this matter back in August (August 12<sup>th</sup> to be precise, 2 days after my birthday). I got a copy of the police report summary (Report Number 040054507) and the records clerk said if I have any additional information I should bring it down so they can add it to the report, in hopes that the culprit can be found quickly.</p>

<p>Our next stop (after some lunch) was to go to my bank and see what I needed to do in order to get Forgery affidavits. Turns out to get an affidavit of forgery it has to be for a specific check number. Well I didn&#8217;t even know how many checks had attempted to be cashed. The bank however was able to search through their online database and find copies of 24 of the checks. They printed out copies of all 24 checks and gave me 24 forgery affidavits, which they notarized.</p>

<p>Next I went over to the district office to see if I could get copies of all 24 checks and all 24 forgery affidavits, I also needed to get a letter (that I had written to the DA) notarized in order to fulfill his requirements in that 3rd to last paragraph. The letter I wrote can be found below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>December 3, 2004<br />
  In regards to: Outstanding Dishonored Checks</p>
  
  <p>Tim Curry<br />
  District Attorney&#8217;s Office<br />
  Criminal Justice Building<br />
  401 W. Belknap<br />
  Fort Worth, TX 76196-0201</p>
  
  <p>Dear Sir:</p>
  
  <p>I received a letter from your office concerning 6 outstanding dishonored checks in my name for a total of $270.29. These checks, and at least 18 more to date, have been written by parties other then me.</p>
  
  <p>On August 12th, 2004 I filled out an Incident Report with the Arlington, Texas Police Department on this matter. The Incident Report Number is 040054507. Copies of all 24 checks have been submitted to the Arlington Police Department in connection with the above Incident Report.As I do not know which 6 of the 24 total checks are in your department, I am enclosing all 24 Affidavits of Forgery for all currently known written checks. I am also enclosing a copy of the Police Report, and 9 letters from collection agencies that have concluded that the checks in their possession are indeed fraudulent.</p>
  
  <p>I do fully agree with the statement in your letter that &#8220;a criminal offense has been committed in this matter.&#8221; This offense however, was committed against me, not by me. I will do everything in my ability to aid the Police Department and your office in finding and prosecuting those parties who are responsible for this crime.</p>
  
  <p>If you are in need of further information from me in this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me, either via mail, or by phone at 817-905-2239 any time.</p>
  
  <p>Respectfully,<br />
  Nicholas Scott Moline</p>
  
  <p>Enclosures (35)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iris at the District Office, who happens to be a Notary Public, notarized the letter. I made my copies and I then went back to the police station and submitted copies of those 24 checks to be added to my record (keeping a copy of them for myself as well).</p>

<p>Finishing up Friday, I sent out a large manilla envelope containing my letter, the DA&#8217;s letter, 24 forgery affidavits, a copy of the police report, and 9 letters from collection agencies that I had already dealt with that happen to agree with me that this was a forgery case (that makes the 35 enclosures)</p>

<p>Saturday night I couldn&#8217;t sleep. I had to run sound for church in the morning and I knew I needed to sleep, but I just couldn&#8217;t sleep, no matter how hard I tried. Eventually I got up and went over to the desk and started the process of entering in the details of the checks that I now had copies of into an excel spreadsheet, hoping to get a running total of how much money I&#8217;ve been screwed over for as well as seeing if I could find any trends in the checks.</p>

<p>Two checks among the bunch really stood out in the crowd as very interesting to me. The first was check number <strong>1098</strong>, dated <strong>9-19-04</strong> to <strong>Dominoes Pizza</strong> for <strong>$42.44</strong>. What made this check really stand out among the pile, besides the fact that that was a whole lot of pizza, was the fact that this was obviously a pizza delivary. I know this because Dominoes affixed the Driver Slip to the back of the check before they endorced it.</p>

<p>Now almost all of the checks, except this one, had phone numbers written on the front of the check by the person who wrote it, all of these numbers different, and none of them valid, but this one had a phone number and <strong>address</strong> <strong>***printed***</strong> on the driver slip.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3708 Carriage Hill Dr<br />
  Fort Worth, TX 76140-1336<br />
  (817) 561-0246</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I looked up the phone number in <a href="https://www.anywho.com/reverse-phone-lookup">AnyWho Reverse Lookup</a> and couldn&#8217;t help but grin when I saw that it belonged to a <strong>Kimberly Clason</strong>, who just happens to live at <strong>3708 Carriage Hill Drive</strong>. I looked up the address in mapquest and this address is just 3 miles from the office where I often do consulting jobs. An office that has a large dumpster out back that I use when my car gets incredibly cluttered and the time comes to clean it out. What must have happened is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I returned to Texas from North Carolina, distraught at losing my job (see previous articles on the subject) and in just plain bad spirits. My car was, once again in a state of disarray, with random papers and things in the back. I stopped one day at the dumpster after doing a consulting job and attempted to clean it out a little.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>I saw some checks that were now from an account that had been closed since before I moved to North Carolina in the first place and, without thinking clearly (in fact with so little thinking that I don't even remember doing it), I threw out the remaining checks in the dumpster.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Who should happen upon these checks? But Kimberly Clason, or one of her family members or friends. They said "woohoo, lookie here, some checks, let's go on a shopping spree" and that's just what they did.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I figured my case should be closed and we should have no problem catching the jerks responsible for attempting to ruin my life, but then another check appears to me, also very interesting.</p>

<p>Check number <strong>1130</strong>, dated <strong>8-22-04</strong> (yes, a much later check number dated almost a month earlier, but that&#8217;s not the interesting thing), to Brookshires for <strong>$80.53</strong>. This check was obviously to be cashed, rather then just buying groceries because the store made him stick his thumbprint on the back and then stamped around the thumbprint a stamp saying &#8220;AUTHENTIPRINT&#8221;. So I have one check with a verifiable name, address, and phone number attached, and another one with a fingerprint.</p>

<p>Monday I call the police station and ask if it would be possible to talk to the detective in charge of my case (they had told me at the records office that a detective is assigned to every case) and was shortly told that no detective has been assigned (remember, I filed this report back in <strong>August</strong>) because they don&#8217;t assign detectives to these types of cases until a merchant complains.</p>

<p>A Merchant has obviously complained because I got the above letter from the District Attorney, but still no detective has been assigned to my case, and nobody will talk to me, so even though I have loads of evidence that could help find the people actually responsible for this crime, nobody will talk to me, I can&#8217;t show it to anyone, and I still face the possibility that I may be going to jail.</p>

<p>And people wonder why Identity Theft is the fastest growing crime in America, cause the justice system goes after the victims, not the criminals, and when the victim finds evidence against the criminals, the justice system doesn&#8217;t want to hear it.</p>

<p>Anyway so here we are, this is how things have been going in my ongoing case against me in identity theft.</p>

<p>Lots of nifty new features. I don&#8217;t think I care for the built in gallery, especially as I have worked so long and hard on my own gallery and it would be quite painful to start over. So I will soon be editing the gallery link shown above to point to my gallery instead of using the one now built into BLOG:CMS. I&#8217;m also not sure why I would need/want a WIKI system on my site. I do however kinda like the new forum feature, not to mention the fact that all blog entries are automatically added to the forum for all to see and now comment on. Theoretically this entry has already been added to the gallery so you should be able to start posting away your comments about it, assuming you care at all that is.</p>

<p>This accounts for a total of 12 semester hours, which gives me full time status, thus allowing me to get back on mom&#8217;s flight benefits.</p>

<p>You may also notice that every class is Tuesday/Thursday, this gives me Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to do consulting if I have any consulting jobs to do. Also, since I&#8217;ll have flight benefits again, this gives me the ability to travel more flexibly, as it will give me a 4 day weekend every weekend, Friday through Monday as far as school commitments are concerned, so I can do weekend trips.</p>

<p>School starts on <time datetime="2005-01-18">January 18th</time></p>

        <p>That&#8217;s right, I said today was a good day. Now I&#8217;m actually referring to Friday, as not enough of Saturday has occurred yet to make it a good day or a bad day, but here&#8217;s how things went down today.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I was woken up earlier then I expected by <a href="http://www.goosite.net/">Goo</a> wanting to once again talk about his latest gaming fad <a href="http://www.guildwars.com/">GuildWars</a>. After he talked to me for a good hour it was fairly apparent I was not going to get back to sleep, so I went and took a shower and got ready for the day.</p>

<p>Upon getting ready I called the <abbr title="Southwestern District of the Christian and Missionary Alliance">SWDCMA</abbr> office to see if Dan was there. See last week I worked hard on creating a new version of their website, but I have not yet been able to meet with the Superintendant about this new version to see if they like it or hate it. This is mostly my fault because I was supposed to head down there last Friday, but last Friday was the day from hell and I never got away from my first job of the day that will never ever pay me.</p>

<p>Anyway back to today. Iris said that Dan was there, and that if I headed down there straight away they would take me out to lunch so that they could discuss the questions they had about the website over lunch.</p>

<p>I headed down there, arrived about 12:30 or so, and talked with Dan, talking him through the basics of the metadot system and showing him some of the site features. Then at about 1 o&#8217;clock, Dan and Iris took me to a local <a href="http://www.saltgrass.com/">Saltgrass Steakhouse</a> where I had an incredible lunch paid that Dan very kindly paid for. Through lunch I was able to answer a lot of their questions about the features and they were sounding more and more excited about what the new interactive version of the website was going to be able to do for them.</p>

<p>My steak eating was interrupted by my cell phone ringing. My mother was on the other side of the line and she asked me to try and head down to my old school (<abbr title="Tarrant County College">TCC</abbr>) to find out how much it would cost for me to go back to school next semester because she has found out how she can get a great deal on a loan from her work&#8217;s credit union and she would really like to see me going back to work on completing my education. Now I never was able to make it down to the college today, but I will be going down there tomorrow.</p>

<p>The reason I never made it down to the college is because I spent the next 4 hours in the district office talking them through the finer points of what the metadot system can do. The more I told them about the various features in the new version of the site, the more excited about it they became. At the end of the day, they made sure to tell me that I need to make sure to bill them for those hours of training at my standard consulting rate, so for an incredibly enjoyable afternoon of training people on their new website, I will get a pretty decent day&#8217;s wages (4 hours at $40/hour).</p>

<p>While I was training them on their website, one of their tenants (they lease out office space in the building to other businesses) came by and when she found out what I was doing, talked to me briefly and I will be meeting with her on Tuesday at 10 o&#8217;clock about creating her a website as well, which will be some more income from creating a new site, as well as new residual income from a new hosting customer.</p>

<p>While I was driving home I decided to make a couple phone calls. I called my pastor who has a small job for me to do tomorrow, which will bring in a little bit of extra income next week, and I called <a href="http://www.goosite.net/">Goo</a>. Goo turned out to be at a computer consulting job of his own, and although he wasn&#8217;t able to fully solve her problem, I apparently called at an opportune time because I was able to offer a little advice, not to mention remind him that he needs to head back to his home to watch <em>Enterprise</em> cause there&#8217;s no way he was going to want to miss Part 2 of the 3 part saga with special guest star: Brent Spiner</p>

<p>I got home with an hour to spare before <em>Enterprise</em> and had a very nice dinner when mom brought home salad and chicken tenders to make a very nice and simple chicken salad. _Enterprise&#8217;_s episode tonight was absolutely excellent. &#8220;Cold Station 12&#8221; was an incredibly enjoyable way to spend an hour and I am excited about reviewing the episode for the SubspaceLink later this weekend.</p>

<p>After the show I got online where I found out that there was a task waiting for me with the <abbr title="A Call To Duty Roleplaying">ACTDR</abbr> <abbr title="Networks Operation Center">NOC</abbr> team. I have been asking for a task to do with that team, as I am supposedly a member of that team for months now. The task happened to be one that was right up my line of expertise and I was able to knock it out easily, helping me with my great sense of accomplishment today.</p>

<p>With my girlfriend we were finally able to play a game that both of us have been wanting to play for months now but neither of us have been able to find the time. The game went very well and we both enjoyed it tremendously.</p>

<p>And I wrapped up the highly productive day with a double-dose of accomplishment, first by finishing a task I had taken up to help <a href="http://blog.cherry-tree.net/">Jadzia</a> a few weeks ago but until today had been unable to accomplish it. I was able to get her new multi-site search system up and running and she thinks her client will find it satisfactory.</p>

<p>The final dose of accomplishment has been writing this blog entry. I know that may not seem like much, but look at my backlog, when is the last time I sat down and wrote an actual blog entry. Last week&#8217;s political commentary about <a href="http://www.lifeofben.com/blog">Ben</a>&#8217;s belief that the Senate is overrated does not count as a real blog entry because it doesn&#8217;t say anything about my life.</p>

<p>Yes indeed, it was a very good day. Of course, since today was such a good day, it&#8217;s highly likely that tomorrow I will have a horrible accident and lose an appendage or something, cause what goes up must come down and my mood today is definitely up, then again, tomorrow could be a good day too. Here&#8217;s hoping and praying!</p>

        <p><em><strong>2011 Editorial note:</strong> over the years Ben eventually Abandoned his blog and the original post is gone, you can see a copy of Ben&#8217;s original article on the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050409002548/http://www.lifeofben.com/blog/67">Wayback Machine on the Internet Archive here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Ben posted on his blog today about a plan on how to &#8220;fix&#8221; the United States Legislative Branch by getting rid of the Senate. In his view, the Senate makes representation unfair because since each state gets two senators, in some states, like Alaska, the senator represents a lot fewer people than a senator from other states, like California. I must say I disagree with his assessment on the health of our checks and balances system, and here&#8217;s why.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Ok, according to Ben&#8217;s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050409002548/http://www.lifeofben.com/blog/67">blog entry</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quite simply, I think we need to get rid of the Senate. In the old days, of course, when state sovereignty was more important than national sovereignty, the Senate existed to ensure that no one state held greater legislative power than another due to greater population. The concept here is that The State is a macrocosm of The Individual Voter, and that since every voter has the same amount of power regardless of size, color or creed, so too should The State have the same amount of clout regardless of population.</p>
  
  <p>This system ensures equal rights on a state level, but in my mind creates great inequality on an individual level. For example, a Senator from California represents, say, 5 million voters, while a Senator from Alaska represents less than 1 million. Each of these Senators&#8217; votes is worth the same when deciding an issue of national significance. Ergo, every individual vote that gets Alaska&#8217;s Senator elected is worth 5 Senatorial election votes in California, which means that 1 voter in Alaska has 5 times the legislative power of an Californian voter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is apparently picking those figures out of mid air instead of doing the research directly. If he were to post the actual figures, the difference in weight of residents to a senator is even more staggering.</p>

<p>The estimated population of Alaska in 2003 was <code>648,818</code>, while the estimated population of California in 2003 was <code>35,484,453</code>. Since in the Senate EVERY state gets 2 votes, that means that each senator in Alaska represents less than 325 thousand people, while each senator in California represents over 17 million. A lot more then his 5 to 1, it&#8217;s actually that going by the Senate alone, a vote for a Senator is nearly 55 times more potent in Alaska then it is in California.</p>

<p>So why, if this is so, do I speak against Ben&#8217;s theory of a senate-deprived legislature? Because the point of the Senate is not to represent the American, but the state citizen. The point of the House of Representatives is to represent the American. And those 2 things really DO need to balance each other out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t we all American?&#8221; you say? Well yes, but we are also members of our own states, and each state has its own system of Values and its own culture. And if all we had was the House of Representatives, then the needs of those individual cultures would be smothered by the values of other cultures.</p>

<p>Rather than use Ben&#8217;s example states of California and Alaska, allow me to pick an example that hits a bit closer to home. Ben lives in Nevada, while I live in Texas.</p>

<p>Texas has 32 members of the house of Representatives, Nevada only has 3. The reason for this is the difference in populations. There are an estimated <code>22,118,509</code> people who live in Texas (or at least in 2003). There are only an estimated <code>2,241,154</code> people who live in Nevada (about 10 Texans for every 1 Nevadan). Now, as just about everyone knows, Nevada gets a great deal of its income from the fact that it has legalized gambling. Texas does not get this revenue. Let&#8217;s say a Texan representative decides to sponsor a bill to make gambling illegal nationwide. From a Texan point of view, it makes sense, Texans are taking their money out of Texas and spending it in Nevada, by making Gambling illegal nationwide they won&#8217;t do this.</p>

<p>In my hypothetical example, let&#8217;s say that it goes to a vote. Nevadans don&#8217;t want to outlaw gambling (at least the Nevadan government doesn&#8217;t because that&#8217;s where it gets all its money). Nevadan representatives vote no, Texan representatives vote yes. Motion carries, why? Cause Texas&#8217; 32 votes trump Nevada&#8217;s 3.</p>

<p>Now you have eliminated the Senate so without further check except a stamp by the president, it becomes a law. Nevada&#8217;s large gambling cities of Las Vegas and Reno become ghost towns, people working there lose their jobs and fall into poverty. Unemployment skyrockets, Nevada calls for federal economic disaster relief, but the Texans are happy, the Texas residents keep their money in Texas instead of taking it to Nevada and having the Nevadans get tax revenue off of it. Texas residents now spend it in Texan stores, and sales tax revenue in Texas goes up.</p>

<p>See the whole point of the Senate was to make sure that large states are unable to simply prey on the smaller ones. Without this check and balance in there, the cultural values of one area of the country could destroy another part. Fortunately, we check both in America. In the house of representatives, the &#8220;American&#8221; gets its equal vote. Each representative represents approximately the same number of people. In the house, the cultural differences of different states get their equal vote. The desires of one state can&#8217;t overpower another. It&#8217;s a balanced system.</p>

<p>This is why I don&#8217;t support the destruction of the Senate, without the Senate, a few large states (California, New York, Texas) will completely control the destiny of the entire country, now do you really want the entire nation run entirely by actors, cowboys and people from Brooklyn? I don&#8217;t.</p>

        <p>Much of my normal every day life (such as my programming projects like the cabin booking system I&#8217;ve been working on for Pastor Tom, and the writing of my novels) have taken a back seat lately to my continued work on getting PortalKeeper off the ground. Tonight I had a conference call with my business partners and a couple other associates who are working on this project.</p>

<p>In this conversation I showed the results of my searches trying to find average costs for the leasing of the office space and we discussed the other things I&#8217;m going to have to find costs on for our next conference call which is scheduled for 9 p.m. Central Time next Tuesday.</p>

        <p>Well further to my message yesterday, it seems I have a new claim to fame.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>For 1 minute today I owned 38.5% of Slashdot in the Blogshares fantasy stock market.</p>

<p>Confused? Of course you are, allow me to explain. At 12:09 p.m. Central time today I received the following e-mail:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have been given 186000 shares in SlashDot.Org by PaperFrog<br />
  http://blogshares.com/user.php?id=6629</p>
  
  <p>Check your profile here: http://blogshares.com/user.php?id=19060 . Mesage from player:</p>
  
  <p>Have fun with these shares or their proceeds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now Slashdot only has 482500 shares total. Doing the math (<amp-mathml layout="container" data-formula="\[ p = 186000 / 482500 * 100 \]" inline></amp-mathml>) I come up with the detail that I owned 38.549223% of Slashdot.org. Very cool, I owned a sizable percentage of one of the most popular geek sites on the net. A Claim to fame. But one minute later (at 12:10) I received 3 e-mails in quick succession:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You were forced to sell 18600 out of the 186000 shares you own in SlashDot.Org for B$1,985.24 ea. (3x the current market price) because Jorge Yau restructured the blog using a Anne Frank&#8217;s Diary (artefact).</p>
  
  <p>Your account has been credited a total of B$36,925,534.80 for this transaction which brings it to B$36,925,594.05. http://blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slashdot.org%2F</p>
  
  <p>You were forced to sell 26784 out of the 167400 shares you own in SlashDot.Org for B$1,985.24 ea. (3x the current market price) because Jorge Yau restructured the blog using a Bloggers (artefact).</p>
  
  <p>Your account has been credited a total of B$53,172,769.70 for this transaction which brings it to B$90,098,363.12. http://blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slashdot.org%2F</p>
  
  <p>Your 140616 shares in SlashDot.Org were sold at B$1,985.24 ea. (3 x B$661.75 &#8211; the current price) because Jorge Yau performed a hostile takeover using a Bon Vivant (artefact).</p>
  
  <p>Your account has been credited a total of B$279,157,037.62 for this transaction which brings it to B$369,255,400.74.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I only owned 38% of slashdot for less then 1 minute, but the end result was that I ended up with B$369 million. Pretty good considering yesterday I had B$500. In <a href="http://blogshares.com/user.php?id=19060">my profile on blogshares.com</a> it says that I have: <strong>73,916,391.64%</strong> growth in net worth this month. Now if only the real stock market worked so well that someone could start with $500 and have $369 million 24 hours later&#8230;..</p>

<p>So anyway&#8230; Much thanks to PaperFrog for the massive gift on Blogshares. As for Jorge Yau, even though you took something really cool from me, thank you anyway cause when you forced me to sell to you, you forced me to sell at tripple the market value so I ended up with a lot of B$ in that transaction.</p>

        <p>no, I&#8217;m not going to sing a christmas song&#8230;</p>

<p>Earlier today JMac asked me if I played with the Blogshares fantasy stock game involving blogs as the &#8220;companies&#8221; that one is trading for. I had never been there before, but it sounded interesting so I setup a user there. I was surprised to find out that my blog was already listed on blogshares.com and that someone has already purchased 4000 shares in it. Further more there are so far 2 changes in stock value of Cap&#8217;s Log, in April it was worth $32.08 a share and in May it was worth $43.58, so that&#8217;s cool. I&#8217;m sure there are much more popular blogs out there but, it&#8217;s cool that I&#8217;m listed.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The annoying thing is, because this is my blog, I get 1000 shares automatically, but someone else has already purchased 4000 shares, so that means that even though this is my site, I only own 20% of the market share of Cap&#8217;s Log&#8230; This is indeed an interesting past time. I intend to buy shares of JMac&#8217;s blog as soon as they become available for purchase</p>

        <p>Spent much of the day working on fixing and moving the Deathstar, and dealing with the chaos that was caused by fixing and moving the Deathstar. Sadly the Deathstar seemed to blow a fuse in it&#8217;s wireless card and it&#8217;s connection to the internet was becoming incredibly intermittant.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>So my first task was to determine it was not a software problem, so I then took the box offline and removed the wireless card and put the load balancing nic card back in it. I then drove to Fry&#8217;s Electronics to buy some Cat6 Patch cables and a battery backup unit for the server (to TRY and keep it online in future brownouts). I came back here and went about moving the server next to a desk in the study (where I could directly plug it into the router as well as bypass the router entirely and plug directly into the cablemodem). Well then I tried to get the software setup and determined that the cablemodem did not like that load balancing nic card for some reason and would not lease it an ip address, no matter if the router was on or off. So I disabled the dual nic that was plugged into the cablemodem and went straight off the switch built into the wireless router (still hardwired but on the LAN side of the network instead of the WAN side).</p>

<p>Anyway it was about this point I realized that in all my working next to and behind that desk, I had broken the desk. I spent a great deal of time trying to fix the desk but I simply could not fix it alone. So I simply hoped the desk would not fully collapse until after my father got home so that we could fix it together.</p>

<p>Mom came home and reminded me that I had agreed to go with her to a Fish Fry at the home of someone from her new church. I went, a bit nervous that I would not make it home in time to get online at 8 p.m. for my ACTD mission. Well it was one day I was really glad I had not eaten all day, the food was excellent. There was great fried catfish, excellent potato salad, amazing cole slaw, a surprisingly sweet kraut salad, and a good and heavy carmel cheesecake.</p>

<p>Suffisive to say, I left there full and satisfied, and it was nice to meet mom&#8217;s new friends. I made it home with little time to spare to make it on for the ACTD game&#8230; And then Dad and David came home from the hardware store and started working on that desk I mentioned earlier (they had come home while I was at the Fish Fry, noticed the broken desk, and gone to the hardware store to buy brackets and braces to fix it). Well while they were working on that they unplugged/unhooked the wireless router SEVERAL times, which knocked both me (for my ACTD game) and the deathstar offline over and over again, to the chagrin of myself, my crewmates on the Arcadia, and all the gamers trying to play SFC3 on the Deathstar.</p>

<p>And then, as I previously mentioned, I worked on my and my imzadi&#8217;s blogs to fix them up.</p>

<p>A very busy day&#8230;.</p>

        <p>Ok, now that I&#8217;m using the <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> mime type instead of <code>text/html</code>, using a <a title="Get Firefox" target="_blank" href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox">real browser</a> shows you where you have improperly formatted W3C incompliant code on your pages. So I&#8217;ve gone through each and every blog entry and fixed the errors in my old badly formatted xhtml. I&#8217;ve also (while I was editing them) gone through the trouble of unlocking all the entries that had locked themselves in the transition from MT to BLOG:CMS. This means that all entries can now be karma voted, and all entries can now be commented on.</p>

<p>Also tonight I upgraded Lori&#8217;s blog to the same updated version of the software that I&#8217;m using.</p>

        <p>I came to the SWDCMA office at about 6:00 Saturday afternoon. As you can see from the datestamp on this entry, it is now almost 5 a.m. on Sunday morning. I&#8217;m still here.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The reason I came here was to install the Battery Backup unit I <a href="2004-08-15-generosity">mentioned in my earlier post</a>, as well as install a modem that we purchased at the same time in another computer that was going to go to a home user and therefore needed a modem to allow it to dial in.</p>

<p>Well the Battery Backup was installed easily enough. I unhooked the old battery backup, hooked the new one up, setup automated monitoring of the battery status on the server, then moved the old battery backup <em>(which still worked fine but didn&#8217;t provide battery power long enough for the highly important use of the servers)</em> to a workstation in the network where the battery backup it had was not functioning&#8230;. at all.</p>

<p>The modem was another story, I took the old non-functioning modem out, stuck in the new <em>(Better, i.e. more expensive)</em> one, fired it up and&#8230; couldn&#8217;t get it to dial out. Well perhaps the old modem wasn&#8217;t bad at all, perhaps it was the computer? I updated everything on that thing, formatted and reinstalled Windows 2000 from scratch (which took HOURS because the format took 2 hours in and of itself), updated the BIOS, everything I could think of, and the modem would not dial. I even tried upgrading it to XP (just to see if it was Windows 2000&#8217;s problem), still didn&#8217;t work. I then took the computer out to another place in the office and tried plugging it into another phone jack. Low and behold, it fired right up, just fine dialed out and sent me a fax.</p>

<p><em>Note, for my reputation&#8217;s sake, I should tell you that the old modem was tried at multiple jacks, so my thought was that it was the computer, and didn&#8217;t think about moving the computer around and trying other phone jacks.</em></p>

<p>Now realizing I&#8217;m an idiot for not trying that earlier, I realized I now had to format and reinstall 2000 again because they didn&#8217;t want XP on that machine. So several hours later, I&#8217;m now finishing up and will be ready to go home in another hour or so, only to go back to church an hour or so later.</p>

<p>At least in all the time I&#8217;ve been formatting and reinstalling I&#8217;ve taken the opportunity to fire up my laptop and work on upgrading this blog to a new version of the software that runs it. And then afterwards, go make all my personal tweaks to the skins and templates and plugins.</p>

<p>So even though I&#8217;ve done a lot of unnecessary work tonight, I have still had a somewhat productive evening</p>

        <p>I am starting a new tag in this blog called Praises. Here I will report some good things that are happening in my life, this way I can hit the Praises category button and look back at the blessings in my life.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Yesterday <em>(well Friday, so now the day before yesterday)</em> I was working at the SWDCMA office fixing a broken outlook client <em>(Yes, I know, from our techie perspectives all outlook clients are broken, but in this case she had lost all of her e-mail, contacts, calendar, you name it, she lost it)</em>. After I was finished, Iris gave me a lift home. On the way we stopped at Fry&#8217;s Electronics so I could help pick out what Battery Backup they will need to keep their server operational in power outages (their current server just isn&#8217;t cutting it).</p>

<p>After that stop, and the quick drive the rest of the way home I entered the house and went to check the messages on the answering machine.</p>

<p>On the machine was a message for me to call Bridget, a lady from ERCC who run&#8217;s the Compassion Team. I called her back and she told me that she had heard that I <a href="http://cap.subspacelink.com/?itemid=77">Needed Tires</a>. Her husband owns a Firestone store in Fort Worth and they generously were going to provide those tires for me.</p>

<p>Not only did they provide tires and realign my system, but because I was on my doughnut, Bridget drove in front of me so that if I were to get another flat on the way, there would be someone there to help me.</p>

<p>I am truly grateful for this great help in my time of need.</p>

        <p>Well today was my birthday, I spent the vast majority of my day listening to Microsoft spokespeople telling me how great Microsoft is&#8230; But hey, it was a TS2 event so I get a free copy of Microsoft Office for giving them my time, and the seminars were quite enlightening. I learned several details about Windows Server 2003 which will help me with a couple of my consulting customers who use that platform.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I haven&#8217;t gotten much for my birthday this year. An old friend of mine from California sent me a book, which I received last week. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385480016/nickdotpro-20">bird by bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life</a> by Anne Lamott, and so far is an interesting read. I made comment to my old friend about a year ago that I&#8217;ve picked up writing as a hobby and she obviously remembered.</p>

<p>Goo sent me the great gift of cash, in the form of a paypal transaction. The lead sound man at my church gave me a $30 gift certificate to my favorite store, Fry&#8217;s Electronics, and my mother gave me a small book by the lead singer of Mercy Me. She is also, as my &#8220;larger&#8221; present, going to pay to have the tires on my car replaced, which will be nice, because I haven&#8217;t been able to drive anywhere lately.</p>

<p>For my birthday dinner tonight we had steaks, which were very good, and for desert we had Strawberry Shortcake, also very good. David wasn&#8217;t here of course, because <a href="2004-08-02-hes-gone">he is still in Washington state</a> acting in a short film entitled <em>The Steps: Rachel</em>.</p>

        <p>David left yesterday to go to Washington (via Canada since all the flights to Seattle and Portland were all overbooked). His flight was delayed, delayed, and delayed again, so that though his original flight was supposed to leave at 4:30, his flight finally took off at 8:05 and arrived Vancover time at almost 11. I got a call well after I went to sleep (3:57 a.m.) from JMac telling me that he had picked up David alright and that they were back in washington.</p>

<p>So I have the house to myself during the weekdays now, the silence is nice.</p>

        <p>I had a hard time sleeping last night. A Storm was raging all night long and when I wasn&#8217;t being woken up by the extremely loud thunder and hard rain, I was being woken up by horrible nightmares</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I dreamed I was being dangled above the water. I wasn&#8217;t hung in a noose or anything like that but my feet were dangling below me, I was in some sort of harness around my waist. Below me an Aligator (or Crocodile no idea really, can&#8217;t remember how to tell them apart) was leaping out of the water and snapping at my legs trying to eat me. I was kicking the aligator trying to stop it, but it was just a matter of time. I was woken when a bite hit home and the beast chomped down on my legs.</p>

<p>Because of this I had a rather poor night&#8217;s sleep and ended up sleeping in when it finally stopped, I think I finally settled down to a stable sleep about 9:30 and woke again at 1.</p>

        <p>Following my <a href="2004-07-30-tired">Restless night&#8217;s sleep</a> I had a rather busy day. I received calls for support from the SWDCMA, from ERCC, and from FTMC. FTMC I handled over the phone, SWDCMA I started to handle remotely, but in the process of trying to fix their problem I had to upgrade the firmware on their router, which of course resulted in resetting the router&#8217;s settings to factory conditions. So I had to bum a ride from one of David&#8217;s friends to get over to the SWDCMA office and set the router back up.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Things didn&#8217;t slow down after hitching a ride home from Iris. At home I had to deal with Pastor Tom calling wanting a status report on the massive project I&#8217;ve undertaken for his website. Simultaneously while I was talking to him on the cell phone the house phone rang, and David, despite my constant requests not to ever be given the phone at home, gave me the phone so I had to deal with the collection agency on the other end.</p>

<p>I then went to the store with my Dad (actually two stores cause we had to go to Albertsons on the other side of town cause he needed to buy beer for something he is going to cook tomorrow but they don&#8217;t sell it in this part of town, then we went to the closer store where my bank was located so that I could deposit a check.</p>

<p><em>In case anyone has forgotten from the other day, my car is missing a front right tire so I can&#8217;t drive it, which is why I&#8217;m hitching all these rides with everyone.</em></p>

<p>While talking on the phone with my girlfriend tonight we finished reading Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire which we have been reading for over a month and a half now over the phone to each other. Before we start reading OOtP however we are going to finish reading another book we had previously started reading together while I was visiting her.</p>

        <p>I was driving to the district office today to do a small job and also help out Angela get her pictures uploaded when I suddenly heard a strange scraping noise. It took me less then a second to realize I either have got a flat tire and am riding the rim, or something has broken off the bottom of the car and is scraping on the ground.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I was just about to pass Discount Tire Company at the time, so I pulled into the parking lot and got out and saw that lo and behold, my front right tire was completely flat. Not being a man of muscle, I called the house to ask for help. David came to my aid, changed the tire with the spare, and escorted me home. I then had to wait for mother to get home (which she showed up an hour and a half later then Dad expected she would) and then drove her car here to get the job done (I&#8217;m still at the District Office uploading pictures to Angela&#8217;s Photo Gallery).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in a Catch 22 situation (&#8220;I&#8217;m curious, <a href="2004-07-28-catch22">what is the <em>etymology</em> of that idiom?</a>&#8221;) in that I have to work to get money to pay for new tires, but I cannot get to jobs to work unless I have a car that has tires. Oh well, something will get figured out&#8230;. I hope.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>According to WordOrigins.org for the Letter C&#8230;</p>

<hr />

<h3>Catch-22</h3>

<p>This phrase, meaning a situation where one bureaucratic regulation is dependent on another, which in turn is dependent on the first, derives from the 1961 novel of the same name by Joseph Heller:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yossarian looked at him soberly and tried another approach. &#8220;Is Orr crazy?&#8221;<br />
  &#8220;He sure is,&#8221; Doc Daneeka said.<br />
  &#8220;Can you ground him?&#8221;<br />
  &#8220;I sure can. But first he has to ask me to. That&#8217;s part of the rule.&#8221;<br />
  &#8220;Then why doesn&#8217;t he ask you to?&#8221;<br />
  &#8220;Because he&#8217;s crazy,&#8221; Doc Daneeka said. &#8220;He has to be crazy to keep flying combat missions after all the close calls he&#8217;s had. Sure, I can ground Orr. But first he has to ask me to.&#8221;<br />
  &#8220;That&#8217;s all he has to do to be grounded?&#8221;<br />
  &#8220;That&#8217;s all. Let him ask me.&#8221;<br />
  &#8220;And then you can ground him?&#8221; Yossarian asked.<br />
  &#8220;No. Then I can&#8217;t ground him.&#8221;<br />
  &#8220;You mean there&#8217;s a catch?&#8221;<br />
  &#8220;Sure there&#8217;s a catch,&#8221; Doc Daneeka replied. &#8220;Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn&#8217;t really crazy.&#8221;</p>
  
  <p>There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one&#8217;s own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn&#8217;t, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn&#8217;t have to; but if he didn&#8217;t want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.</p>
  
  <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s some catch, that Catch-22,&#8221; he observed.<br />
  &#8220;It&#8217;s the best there is,&#8221; Doc Daneeka agreed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heller originally titled his novel <em>Catch-18</em>, but at the request of his publisher changed it. Leon Uris had just published <em>Mila-18</em> and the publisher did not want confusion between the two books.</p>

        <p>Today I went over to the District Office to again attempt to troubleshoot the problems with their ability to log into the network through a VPN tunnel. Not seeing anything wrong with the server or the setup in the router I did the only thing logical, I printed off the page listing all the ports they had open on the router and reset the router to factory conditions. I then proceeded to set up the router again from scratch.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This did accomplish the task as I had hoped and the VPN access to their network is now repaired. While I was there I discussed with several of them the upcoming District Conference. I&#8217;ve been to the last 2 district conferences and I&#8217;ve been asked to again go and aid them with their audio/visual needs during the conference. The conference will be in mid September in Midland, TX.</p>

<p><strong><em>Ok, I&#8217;m quite annoyed by the fact that everything after this point was lost when I posted my article a few minutes ago and so I am now having to write this again&#8230; So what follows may not be exactly what I wrote before</em></strong></p>

<p>This past week I have found myself in contact with John Savage, my old boss from GetOnTheAir, Inc., the wireless ISP I worked for for much of 2003. While I am glad to talk to my old friend, and I&#8217;m certainly glad to help him out in what small ways I can, this renewed contact with John has served to continuously remind me of the fact that this month marks a year since the Western Carolina Wireless project went under.</p>

<p>Times have been tough for John the past couple years since he was called up to active duty in Iraq the very week I moved to North Carolina to run the WCW project for him. While he was away he was injured in the line of duty, and he&#8217;s received little compensation now that he&#8217;s been medically discharged. Also while he was away, the mortgage company that had the mortgage on his house did some shady dealings and started harassing his wife threatening to foreclose on the house unless she paid the entire balance of the mortgage. And then of course the lack of communication with my boss and the fact that the WCW project was running under a grant made it difficult to keep the granters happy and with about half of the grant payout money never paid, the RIAA retracted funds, terminating the project, leaving me unemployed and with no choice but to return here and work for Harold.</p>

<p>John is now working hard to rebuild his life, which is hard considering he has almost no use of his right arm due to the injury he received in Iraq. I pray he is successful in rebuilding his business.</p>

<p>Tomorrow (today, as now, in the second rendition of this posting it is now almost 2 a.m.), I will be running sound for a Vow Renewal ceremony at church, so that will be interesting. Sunday morning I will be in the sound booth at my normal post of the video matrix, but instead of doing it myself, I will be training a new member of the A/V team in how to work with the video matrix.</p>

<p>Sunday night however will be quite interesting. Mom signed herself, me, and my brother David up to be in an American Airlines training video training AA employees on what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. It should be quite interesting.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started reading <em>Around the World in Eighty Days</em> by Jules Verne. I&#8217;ve never read it before and was not really that surprised that it is shaping up to be quite different from the recent Disney Movie (which btw was quite good and I enjoyed it a lot).</p>

<p>Well I have a busy day tomorrow, so I will end this article, especially since I have now written it twice and am thoroughly not amused at having to write it over again. There were things I said in the previous version of this article that I haven&#8217;t written now, but I will save them from another posting, perhaps tomorrow night. Goodnight all!</p>

        <p>I am working hard on trying to upgrade this blog to a newer version of the Blog:CMS software, unfortunately this is proving to be more difficult then I would have hoped, as all the skins seem to have been messed up royally.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>It seems thatt, perhaps to make the site run faster, changing a template is not such an instant thing anymore, the template change doesn&#8217;t seem to go into effect until I post an entry into my blog. Personally I&#8217;m not to fond of this new &#8220;improvement&#8221; perhaps there is something I can do to rectify this situation&#8230;.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I have now determined that the stuck skins seems to have been a result of a plugin that was loaded called Cache. I have decided that this plugin is a pain in the arse and have unloaded it until what time as I decide my site is ready for that speed up. It is definitely not something that should be loaded when a site is first setup or newly fixed.</p>

<p>I have also decided to put the referrers back for now as the designers of Blog:CMS have hinted that it is not as susceptible to being used for spam anymore, we shall see I suppose. I will of course remove it if they prove to be incorrect.</p>

<p>The most annoying part of this upgrade is the fact that they completely changed the way the poll system works, it is simpler yes, but the problem is it wiped out all my previous polls. Fortunately&#8230; there were only two of them so it&#8217;s not too huge of a loss, but still, I&#8217;d rather not lose poll data, it makes polls inaccurate</p>

<p>In any case there are some nice improvements they have made to the interface, and a number of bugs that have been fixed, so overall I&#8217;m glad I went through the pain of this particular upgrade.</p>

<p>An annoying side effect of my recent change from Movable type to Nucleus was that I lost all my plugins that I had worked so hard to find, well tonight, after finishing the aforementioned upgrade, I am again adding plugins, you may have noticed the countdown on the homepage reminding you how long you have to show for my birthday. Also when I&#8217;ve been reading/watching/listening to something interesting, you will now see a link to the item in my blog entries, such as the entry below to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire which I have been reading to my girlfriend over the phone for a while now. We are nearly done actually. I didn&#8217;t get to read any tonight as I wasn&#8217;t able to talk to her tonight, but last night we read chapter 30, so we are well on our way to finishing.</p>

        <p>I was browsing through my archive, reading from back in the days that I updated this blog often and I found an entry a little over a year ago (July 12th, 2003) where <a href="2003-07-12-personality-disorder-test">I took a Personality Disorder test</a> and posted my results. The end of the results had a link to take the test so I thought it would be interesting if I took the test again to see how I grade a year later. Inside you can find results with their comparison&#8217;s to last year.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Disorder</th>
  <th>July 2003</th>
  <th>July 2004</th>
  <th>Change</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Paranoid:</td>
  <td>Low</td>

  <td>-----------</td>
  <td>-----------</td>
  <td>--------</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Total Changes</td>
  <td></td>
  <td></td>
  <td>-3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Rather then copy/paste the code from their site, I reformatted it so that it is easier to understand the change from last year to this year, the first column shows the disorder name, the second column shows my score after taking the test last time, the third column shows my score this time, and the final column shows the change based on this scale from best to worst:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Low</th>
  <th>Moderate</th>
  <th>High</th>
  <th>Very High</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>4</td>
  <td>3</td>
  <td>2</td>
  <td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Taking the change, so that a change from <strong>Low</strong> to <strong>Moderate</strong> is a change of <strong>-1</strong> cause it moved down the scale 1, while a change from <strong>Moderate</strong> to <strong>Low</strong> would be <strong>+1</strong> cause it would move up the scale one. Unfortunately, there were no upward movements and 2 downward movements (one of them by 2 points), in other words&#8230; According to this test, the condition of my mind has degraded over the last year.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure how accurate this little quiz is, in fact, I&#8217;m fairly certain it is inaccurate, but it&#8217;s a depressing result nonetheless.</p>

<p>Basically what this says is that in addition to my previous problems, I am now Paranoid and Schizoid as well, oh well, one day if I ever get out of my financial mess I may be able to afford to make a Shrink very happy, very happy that he has someone as messed up as I am that is.</p>

<p>Also, 5 days ago was the 1 year anniversary of the day I started writing my first story, Miles Apart over on fanfiction.net. Some of you know that I am currently working on writing my first two novels. Unlike that original story, these are not fanfiction but instead are stories set with my own characters in my own situations. I&#8217;m looking forward to finishing them.</p>

        <p>Actually what this refers to is that last week I went with the Junior High youth group of my church to their first annual Junior High camp (called Rock Camp 2004 cause the name of the Junior High youth group is Rock). I had the wondrous joy of driving a van full of young teenagers and preteens all the way to Oklahoma and back.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The camp took place at Secluded Acres, the cabins and retreat center owned by Pastor Tom. I&#8217;ve been there once before (for the Men&#8217;s Retreat earlier this year).</p>

<p>The topic of the week was <em>&#8220;Fear Factor&#8221;</em> and was quite an interesting session. After one of the sessions (in which there was a game of <em>Name that Phobia</em>, Chris showed me a list he had printed out from a website called <a href="http://www.phobialist.com/reverse.html">The Indexed Phobia List</a>. From this list I&#8217;ve learned such interesting Phobia Names such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Heights:</strong> Acrophobia, Altophobia, Batophobia, Hypsiphobia or Hyposophobia</li>
<li><strong>Home:</strong> Ecophobia</li>
<li><strong>Injections:</strong> Trypanophobia</li>
<li><strong>Justice:</strong> Dikephobia</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Gnosiophobia or Epistemophobia</li>
<li><strong>Love, falling or being in:</strong> Philophobia</li>
<li><strong>Air:</strong> Anemophobia</li>
<li><strong>Water:</strong> Hydrophobia</li>
<li><strong>Phobias:</strong> Phobophobia</li>
<li><strong>Opening one&#8217;s Eyes:</strong> Optophobia</li>
<li><strong>Everything:</strong> Panophobia, Panphobia, Pamphobia, or Pantophobia</li>
</ul>

<p>And my personal favorite</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The fear of Long Words:</strong> Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia</li>
</ul>

<p>He used select ones from this list for the game, but would not let the kids look at the whole list because it also contained such inappropriate entries as:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nudity:</strong> Gymnophobia</li>
<li><strong>Virgins:</strong> Parthenophobia</li>
<li><strong>Losing one&#8217;s Virginity:</strong> Primeisodophobia</li>
<li><strong>Sexual intercourse:</strong> Coitophobia</li>
<li><strong>Losing an Erection:</strong> Medomalacuphobia</li>
<li><strong>Female genitals:</strong> Kolpophobia</li>
<li><strong>Penis:</strong> Phallophobia</li>
<li><strong>Rape:</strong> Virginitiphobia</li>
</ul>

<p>None of which these kids should be thinking about.</p>

<p>The general lessons learned were how to tell the difference between a sensible fear (like the fear of Snakes: <strong>Ophidiophobia</strong>) and unsensible ones (like the aforementioned fears of air, water, and long words). He also taught the kids a bit about The Fear of the Lord. As well as talking to them about how they can conquer their fears.</p>

<p>The week itself was fun, although because it had been raining before the camp, there was too much water in the river to go canoeing (too much water for boats&#8230;.). The second day (Wednesday June 30th) my cell phone was disconnected because of the hugh bill I had last month and the fact that I had not paid it yet, so I was completely out of contact with the outside world. Fortunately the server did not explode during this time and so my customers are not upset with me.</p>

<p>I did unfortunately miss a call on Wednesday from the SWDCMA asking me to come in Thursday, and since I never knew about the call, I couldn't call them back and tell them I was out of state and couldn't go on Thursday.</p>

<p>I brought <em>Glorious Appearing</em> with me to read but I did not get any of it read. Instead I used my free time to continue writing my own book.</p>

        <p>Well I'm changing blog systems to BLOG:CMS because Movable Type has gone commercial. I chose BLOG:CMS because it was based on Nucleus (which was open source (aka, non commercial) and has a nifty little importer feature where I can import all my blog entries from MovableType and thus.. not lose anything. BLOG:CMS was nice as well because it had a number of built in skins and templates and plugins, so without waiting for JMac to figure out how to port my beautiful old blog template over to a new one, I can at least have a somewhat functional skin right off the bat. There are also a number of nifty add-ins that BLOG:CMS has by default that would be difficult in MovableType.</p>

<p>It's been a fun week but I'm exhausted. A Whole week of going to church at 8:30 in the morning (including last Sunday where I went at 8 cause I was running powerpoint) when I've been getting used to not having anywhere to go in the morning was taking it's toll on me. Plus there was always something I needed to do in the afternoons and evenings too so I was getting home at like 9 p.m. every night and was so exhausted I wanted to go straight to sleep. Tonight I'm going to try and get the Death Star (The GOC gaming server) on-line.</p>

<p>Goo is rather ticked at me lately since I was going to try and get this thing online over a week ago but haven't even plugged it in yet.</p>

        <p>The next couple days after my vacation were over were jam packed.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>First, on Saturday (May 28th), a couple good friends of mine, Pedro Cortez and Crystal Cooper, were married. My brother David was one of Pedro's groomsman. It was a beautiful ceremony, and I am very happy for them.</p>

<p>The next day, Sunday (May 29th), my brother graduated High School&#8230; No, I'm not joking, David graduated High School, so anyone who knows my mother should tease her that there are no longer any school aged children in the house. I have put up a number of pictures of Davids graduation in my Gallery. I really need a better camera&#8230;.</p>

<p>The following week was eventful, I went over to the District office a few times to get some work done.</p>

<p>I was unfortunately unable to talk to my girlfriend for the first few days of the week because she was on vacation in Gattlingburg. I wouldn't have been able to talk to her at all that week except that a few days into it, her teeth really started hurting her, so her family had to go home early. I&#8217;ve been praying for her teeth ever since.</p>

<p>Thursday I had a double feature day. It had been the first time I had gone to see a movie since the <em>Passion of the Christ</em>, so I was very eager to see a movie again. I had already bought my ticket to go see <em>Harry Potter: and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em> at 12:01 a.m. (yes that&#8217;s right, I went to go see a kids movie at midnight on the first showing, I like Harry Potter OK?) but earlier in the day David really wanted to go see a movie, so we went to see Shrek 2. Both movies were excellent and I greatly enjoyed them.</p>

<p>My girlfriend went to the dentist yesterday to see about her teeth and they told her that she was going to need to see a specialist, so she&#8217;s worried about the cost of that.</p>

<p>Yesterday I began a process I like to call <strong>The Big Clean &#8211; June 2004</strong>. My room has been a mess, so it&#8217;s high time I start trying to get it clean. To get an idea how bad it was, I&#8217;ve taken several &#8220;before&#8221; pictures which can be seen in my gallery.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve taken a bit of a break from that to write these back blog entries.</p>

<p>Also yesterday I had a interview for an Executive Officer position in ACTD, that was interesting, I hope I get it. I created this character back in 1998, and it would sure be nice for him to finally be able to have some command experience. There have been people I&#8217;ve known who joined ACTD after I did but are SM (Ship Managers) while my character is still a Lieutenant.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to <strong>The Big Clean June 2004</strong>&#8230;.</p>

        <p><em>Note added May 2006 &#8211; I once had a nice intro passage here, but as this trip was to see my then Girlfriend, and we have had a parting of the ways since it seems that she got into my site and edited the intro paragraph at some point since the breakup.  I can't remember what was once here so I won't even try to rewrite it, just know that what is enclosed in this blog entry was the story of the trip I took to Tennessee to visit her and to try and get a job so I could move closer to her.  In hindsight, I'm rather glad I didn't get that job actually.</em><br />
<!--more--></p>

<p>I made it to Huntsville Alabama without any problems, where I waited on a bench at the curb for a while (Flight got in at about 10:30, and I was picked up around 1 or so). My girlfriend and her mother picked me up at the airport and after dropping her mother back off at her home, My Girlfriend took me to <a href="http://www.dotspot.net/">DotSpot</a> where my job interview was. I think the interview went pretty well, though they did say that it was going to be a little while before they were ready to hire anyone.</p>

<p>That afternoon my girlfriend and I first went over to the local Wal-Mart where I had her ring finger sized and had them send the promise ring I had already bought for her to be sized to match (She got it back yesterday), then we went to the park and spent some time reading together. I had my first kiss there in that park that day. I will never forget Monday, May 24th, 2004 as the day I had my first kiss.</p>

<p>We spent the next few days together, we both took our resumes around to a couple other places and I just generally enjoyed spending time with her.</p>

<p>Thursday I tried to come back, I even made the flight (I fly standby so I'm never completely sure if I'm going to get on a plane or not) and waited in the plane for 3 hours because thunderstorms at DFW were causing all flights heading that way to be delayed. Eventually they did decide to feed us our dinner on the ground while we waited, which I'm glad they did, because after 3 hours of waiting, they eventually cancelled the flight altogether as DFW airport had to be shut down.</p>

<p>I had very little money left at this point, but I decided to go over to the hotel that was in the airport and ask how much it would cost for a room for the night, when I got over there they said that unfortunately they were booked solid so I went down to the lobby area of the airport and prepared to spend the night sitting in one of the chairs there. I called my girlfriend and started talking to her, hoping at least not to be bored.</p>

<p>After sitting there for a while however, the man I had talked to at the desk of the hotel came down and found me in the lobby and asked me if I was still in need of a room, I said I was if it was inexpensive enough for me to afford. He said that there was one room available but it didn't have a bed, it did have a cot and a nice armchair though, which, coupled with privacy and the chance to shower in the morning, was definitely worth the $28 he said it would cost me to stay there for the night. He started taking me up to the room so I could see it, when he met up with someone else on his staff who said that there were 2 rooms available that were clean and somehow not accounted for, so he put me in one of them, so I actually got a nice king sized bed to sleep in.</p>

<p>The next morning, I got up early to go wait for the first flight out, but because of the cancelled flight the night before, it was now overbooked, so not only did I not get on that one, but some people who actually paid for their tickets didn't either.</p>

<p>A Couple hours later one of them, who had gotten a $20 meal voucher from the airline in addition to his $200 travel voucher, was gracious enough to buy me a sandwich with his meal voucher. Apparently he had to use it all at once and get no change, so since he just wanted a sandwich at Subway, he had extra money, so I was able to actually eat on Friday.</p>

<p>Finally I was about to get on the 5:09 flight, the last one of the day and make it home.</p>

        <p><em>don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ll be back again</em>, ok so that&#8217;s not true, I&#8217;m currently planning on returning on Thursday.  It&#8217;s been a very rough week. As many of you are aware, PortalKeeper and WhiteDog have been working feverous all week to try and get a new server online and all the data transferred from the old server to the new one because if the old server were to stay online this coming week, White Dog would get a bill for nearly twice as much as it had been previously getting because FastServers.net is drastically increasing their prices.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I&#8217;ve had to be working double fast because I am leaving this morning for my 4 day vacation to Tennessee, so though the actual deadline is tonight, my deadline is.. about an hour from now.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, Saturday Night I was pulling an all nighter on the couch with my laptop trying to get this task done, well somewhere around 5/5:30 Sunday morning I crashed and fell asleep, with the laptop on my lap. When I woke up at 8:10 (I was supposed to be AT ERCC no later then 8:00 to run powerpoint, I woke up late because I was nowhere near my alarm) the laptop was no longer on my lap, it was on the floor. I attempted to turn it on, nothing, so I unplugged the AC adaptor from the back of the laptop and plugged it back in again, as soon as it went back in, POOF, sparks fly and smoke billows out the back of the laptop, it&#8217;s completely dead.</p>

<p>So I have absolutely no way to work at all while I&#8217;m in Tennessee for the next several days. Perhaps it is fate, perhaps I&#8217;m not supposed to work and I&#8217;m supposed to take the next few days to actually relax, though it&#8217;s hard to relax when there&#8217;s a brand new server freshly configured running with barely any testing time and me nowhere near a computer to fix it if any of those configurations are incorrect.</p>

<p>I will have a job interview in Tennessee this afternoon and then for the next several days I will have free time there, with a return flight Thursday night.</p>

<p>Because of my lack of a laptop, I will not be posting any blog entries over the course of this week, not that that is much different then any other week cause I hardly ever seem to find the time to sit down and write anymore&#8230;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>Last night my father and I went to a Baseball Game at Ameriquest Field (it was just renamed Friday, before that it was called the Ballpark in Arlington, sponsorships&#8230;.. oy).  Originally all 4 of us were going to go, but then Mom (who was the one who bought the tickets in the first place) ended up deciding to go to Vegas with my Grandma and my Aunt for Mother's Day so she was out of town, we also found out that yesterday was David's Senior Prom so he didn't go either. So a week or two ago Dad gave the other 2 tickets to a friend of his from work.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The tickets included a meal catered by Spring Creek Barbecue. I didn't care for the pulled pork sandwich but I enjoyed the sides, which included baked beans, potato salad, coleslaw, and a cookie. We showed up at about 4:30 which was when the meal time was. When we left the area of the parking lot where the meal was and started walking back to the Stadium (still 2 hours early for the game) it was starting to sprinkle lightly. It continued to be only light sprinkling until we reached the final corner, cross one more street and we would get to the stadium, then it started to pour down rain instantly, and I don't mean &#8220;It was raining&#8221;, I mean, the winds were howling and the water was coming down like a solid wall of water. We were soaked to the bone. Fortunately the rain completely stopped about an hour before game time and the game went on as scheduled, and a very interesting game it was too.</p>

<p>The first inning had no score, but in the second inning the Rangers took the lead as the Tigers scored 2 runs but the Rangers scored 4. In the 3rd and 4th innings however the Tigers scored another 4 runs and the Rangers hadn't scored any, so as they entered the top of the 5th the Rangers were down by 2 runs. The fifth inning was quite impressive however, In the top of the 5th the Tigers scored 8 runs, so the Rangers were now down by 10, and many of us were beginning to think this was not a good night to be at Ranger Stadium. Dad even commented something like &#8220;Man the Rangers are really off tonight&#8221;. The Rangers changed pitchers like 3 times in the inning but still the Tigers were scoring away&#8230;.</p>

<p>Before going into the bottom of the 5th it was announced that it was Taco Bueno Taco Time and if the Rangers score a run in the inning everybody in the stadium would get a coupon for a free Taco at Taco Bueno.</p>

<p>The Rangers didn't disappoint in getting us all tacos, in fact, it's too bad that it wasn't a free taco for each run made, because in the bottom of the 5th the Rangers scored not once, but 10 times, tieing up the game. The 5th inning altogether lasted an hour and 8 minutes, which is more then a quarter of the total length of the game (3 hours 59 minutes) and set a new record for most number of runs in the 5th inning of a MLB game, but the 18 runs was just one shy of setting the MLB record for most runs in a single inning overall. They tied another record in that inning in that between the 2 teams they used a total of 7 pitchers in the inning pitching a total of 100 pitches in the inning.</p>

<p>So after that odd inning the game was tied 14/14. The Tigers were able to get one up in the 6th inning but the Rangers tied it up again in the bottom of the 7th. There were no scores in the 8th or 9th innings but in the 9th inning Alfonso Soriano set a Rangers record by going 6-for-6 and having most hits in a game for Ranger's History. In the extra inning a single drove in someone who was on base and the Rangers won 16 to 15, it was great.</p>

<p>I think this was the 4th game I've been to at that stadium but it's the first of all 4 of them that the Rangers actually won, so it was great to cheer the team on to victory.</p>

<p>Following the game was a Motown themed fireworks display. It was quite impressive and I really liked some of the interesting fireworks, some of which I had never seen the likes of before. During &#8220;Can't Hurry Love&#8221; there were several beautiful heart shaped fireworks, during &#8220;My Girl&#8221; there were cool smiley faces, and during several songs there were these very cool white fireworks that had a double explosion so that each of the flashes that shot out from the center exploded in a smaller explosion pattern to make a very pretty effect that I had not seen before. My description really doesn't do it justice as it sounds like other fireworks, but trust me, this was cool.</p>

<p>There were also fireworks that jetted out all around the stadium at certain points (Such as when the word &#8220;stop&#8221; was stated during &#8220;Stop in the name of Love&#8221; and in large sparkling fountains in &#8220;Rolling on the River&#8221;). In any case, it was a great fireworks display and a great way to cap the evening.</p>

<p>In other news for yesterday and today, yesterday I got up early to go to the Team Leader Huddle at church, which I wasn't exactly sure why I was invited, as I was unaware that I was a team leader, but it was interesting just the same. This morning I woke up late however (still tired from last night and the fact that I've had little sleep over the last 3 days) and I missed church. I'm a little disappointed that I missed church but it being Mother's Day and all they were sure to have long segments to spotlight Mother's Day and since my own Mother wasn't going to be there (as I said before she's in Vegas with <strong>her mother</strong>), I don't think I missed much.</p>

<p>Also yesterday JMac said he got the template for Lori just about done so it should be going live on her site in the next couple days, he showed me the development page for it, it looks really nice.</p>

<p>Tonight ABC is going to show an expanded version of <strong>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</strong> with deleted scenes and a 10 minute preview of the upcoming <strong>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</strong>, which I'm of course looking forward to, so I think I'll be watching that this evening.</p>

<p>That's all for now, <em>TTFN</em>.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;ve finally been to my first frat party. Thursday, Mr. E called to tell me had had a pair of paying sound jobs for me to do on Saturday if I was interested. I said I was. Friday night he e-mailed me that the second event was canceled but that the first event was still going on and I could make extra money there by staying through the whole thing instead of leaving early as I was going to have to do to do the other job. The first job ended up being the annual <abbr title="Brothers Under Christ">BYX</abbr> Island Party at <abbr title="Texas Christian University">TCU</abbr>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><abbr title="Brothers Under Christ">BYX</abbr> is a Christian fraternity so the party was nothing like the fraternity parties you see in the movies, which I was glad for, because it would not have been much fun for me if it was. There was no booze or drugs, and the music was Christian. It was the music of course that I was there for, I was helping out Heaven&#8217;s Sounds Engineering in their task of running sound for the event. I was basically a roadie in that my primary responsibility was to set up and tear down for before between and after the concerts, but also whenever Mr. E needed a short break or had to go check on something, I did temporarily man the board when it needed to be maned so I did a little very simple sound mixing as well.</p>

<p>The party itself was fun, there were plenty of free food and sodas and the <abbr title="Texas Christian University">TCU</abbr> campus is really quite nice, really makes me miss college life, I wish I could be a student again, I missed out on a lot by giving it up so soon.</p>

<p>The first band was horrible, but the second band was pretty good and the headliner of the evening was <a href="http://www.mattwertz.com/">Matt Wertz</a> who I was very impressed with, though I&#8217;ve never heard of him before. He had one song I&#8217;d really like to get a copy of because it really speaks to something I&#8217;ve had to think over a lot lately, and that is my testimony. Matt has a similar problem as me when it comes to sharing our testimonies, because well, My testimony is boring. I simply cannot remember a time I was not a Christian. I cannot remember a time in my life that I did not love the Lord, and this is a hard testimony to share because people seem to find a testimony boring if it doesn&#8217;t involve some massive conversion from a life of misery into a life with Christ. One of the songs Matt sung while he was there was a song called <u>All I Know</u> which is about this very problem, he too has known Christ his entire life. So, if anybody wants to buy me a present, <a href="http://www.awarestore.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=view_item&amp;nav=music&amp;Item_ID=9874&amp;CFID=2000252&amp;CFTOKEN=65703803">his CD with that song on it</a> would be a very nice gift&#8230;.</p>

        <p>You know the expression "<em>It can't possibly get worse?</em>" You know how whenever anyone says that it almost invariably&#8230; DOES get worse? It's been like that for me lately. Any of you who happen to read my blog probably consider me a pessimist with my relatively bleak outlook on life I've had the past several months. You may be right, my depression, which is again in full swing, probably forces me to focus on the negative aspects of life and ignore the good. This past week and a half however, I've been consciously trying to find the good, I have yet to find it.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Last Week was, as most people here in the USA know, tax day, April 15th. I received my W2 from Metrotime Business Systems on April 14th, no, I didn't say January, I said April, as in one day before the taxes were due. And as much as I had wished the W2 would alter my taxes slightly for the better (I had come up with a balance of owing $254 without that 1 W2), hoping that the fact that I claimed 0 deductions on the W4 to get that W2 would cause Metrotime to withhold too much money which would counteract the fact that also during this year I worked (again for Metrotime) under a 1099-MISC. It didn't, in fact, it made things worse, I now owed $306 on my federal taxes, I know that's not that much of a difference, but I didn't have $254 to begin with, $306 was killer. I had a check come in from a job but I didn't get the check UNTIL April 15th, and then too late in the day to deposit it in time, so I borrowed $100 from my father to make sure I had enough money in my account to pay my taxes.</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, I had been given a nice opportunity, in exchange for removing some spy-ware from a couple of Mike Stephen's (the head of my church's Men's Ministry) Computers, he would sponsor my way to go to the Men's Retreat which was leaving that Friday to go to Broken Bow, OK. So I went over there Tuesday evening and spent a number of hours fixing their computers and getting everything generally ship-shape. So Friday I was on my way up to Oklahoma.</p>

<p>My Ride wanted to leave relatively early, so before 10:30 in the morning we were off on our way. We stopped to eat lunch but I had absolutely no money, having had to put every dime of my income into my taxes, but Mike again spotted me a few bucks to try one of those new spicy chicken sandwiches at Burger King, which wasn't half bad btw, had more kick in it then things like that would usually have, and as I like kick, it was pretty good indeed. I was embarrassed being that financially helpless but Mike was very kind about it.</p>

<p>Over all the weekend was very nice, we arrived at about 2 in the afternoon and the first event on the agenda wasn't planned till 9. The reason for arriving so soon? The people who gave me a lift wanted to use the extra time to play some golf, I will never understand why about 85% of the men in this church seem to be addicted to Golf&#8230; but anyway, I quite enjoyed having the entire area practically to myself, I just sat on the porch of one of the cabins and read, listening to the sounds of nature. I had a lot of reading time over the following couple days and read several books from the <em>Chronicles of Narnia</em> series, which was a nice break. The speaker was interesting, but kept going on and on about how to be a happy Christian we should be poor and not own anything because things distract us from what is really important. While in general I agree with him, the Good Lord hasn't blessed me with the ability to have lots of things to distract me. I have my Computer, which is what I use for work, but other then that I own nothing, and I don't even technically own the computer, my Dad bought it with his credit since I have no credit and couldn't be approved for anything.</p>

<p>Saturday I spent much of the day taking pictures for a powerpoint presentation we will play this coming Sunday, which reminds me&#8230;. I need to make that powerpoint presentation&#8230;. I was about to go try out part of the ropes course myself actually, as it has been many years since I've done a ropes course and I was much looking forward to it. I had even climbed part way up the pole when I realized 2 things nearly simultaneously. First, while the harness was holding ME from falling to the ground, it was apparently not stopping my pants from falling, cause my pants were slipping as I was climbing and there wasn't much I could do about it except come down, the second thing I realized was that I had been put in charge of making sure everyone who went on the ropes course had a release form signed (insurance reasons and all that), but though I had so meticulously made sure that everyone was covered, I had started climbing without signing one myself&#8230; So I climbed down, and rather then waste time while I signed the form and found some way to secure my slacks, I just let the next person go and skipped the course.</p>

<p>On Sunday I again got to sit and read while the people who were my ride went off to play golf for a few hours, so I got some more reading done, it was overall a pretty relaxing time, but it was oh so short.</p>

<p>Upon arriving back at home I again found myself in the position of being looked down upon by my Father. Money was gone, and it wasn't going to come back, and what had I done when I ran out of money? I had gone on a retreat. This week hasn't gone all that well, my laptop is broken again and I haven't had time to call Dell and schedule them to come out and fix it again, so I set up the docking station so that the laptop is still usable (if not mobile) on a desk in my room and did some rearranging. I started a project of trying to clean my room, but now my room is much worse then it was when I started the project, so it's not helping much. On top of everything I was going to go out for a paying consulting job today,b ut last night I started coming down with something, and today I'm convinced it's the flu.</p>

<p>So I did not go do the job today so I'm not going to get that little bit of pay. Yesterday I rejoined ACTD but I found out today there are 2 paying sound gigs I can do this Saturday (never done a sound gig for profit before, unless you count the little thank you checks I got from the SWDCMA for District Conference and Team Leadership Conference), but one of them is right smack on top of the first ACTD mission I would have played now that I'm back, so, being in dire need of money, I'm sending the ACTDers an e-mail to let them know that I'm really sorry to do this on my first week back and all, but I've got to miss this week's game to handle the paying gig. It really bites, big time.</p>

<p>But none of this comes close to the worst thing that happened to me this week. I voiced a concern that I had with my girlfriend the day before yesterday, but, as I should have expected, I did a lousy job voicing the concern and she got upset with me. Not at all her fault, by the way, lest anyone reading this misunderstand. The way I said some things that I said came out very arrogant and very much like a jerk, though that was not at all my intention. I came very close to losing her this week I think. The last thing I wanted to do was push away the one I love, but somehow I had let myself do just that, and despite the fact that I love her deeply, I didn't share my concerns very well and she probably felt that she needed to leave me, rather then put up with me being a jerk. I'm very sorry Imzadi, my concerns were real, what I said was real, but the way I said it needed a lot more tact, and for that, I deeply apologize.</p>

<p>She says things are ok now, but I'm not sure that she fully trusts me not to be a jerk. She is the best thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life, and I nearly blew it. The only joy in my life right now, and I was pushing her away.</p>

<p>Well I'm feeling weak so I'm going to lay down for a few, perhaps she'll call tonight, but she doesn't often get to call on Thursday nights because of some weird schedules in her family involving telephone use, so I may not be able to talk to her again until tomorrow night. On the up side, last night I finished Reading <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</em> to her and today I began reading <em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em> to her. Our goal is to finish <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em> before the corresponding movie comes out in June.</p>

        <p>Well I <a href="2004-04-22-week-from-hell">previously posted</a> today a number of things that were wrong with the week, now I&#8217;ve got some more. It turns out the hosting provider, fastservers.net, that hosts the server I&#8217;m sharing with some other companies, is nearly doubling their prices effective next month. So now we&#8217;ve got to get a new server set up somewhere else, transfer all the files, and then close down the old one because otherwise we are going to have downtime. In addition I am being sent a server from another company to get a second server set up and I haven&#8217;t the foggiest idea where I&#8217;m going to send this server that will be cost effective hosting for it. Also, one of my plug-ins (GeoSketch) for this blog seems to be malfunctioning because I had a nifty animated map that zoomed into Broken Bow, Oklahoma in my <a href="2004-04-22-week-from-hell">last post</a> that for whatever reason will simply not display, it displays the code instead, so I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s up with that, I removed the map from the entry from now after trying 3 times to get the map to show to no avail&#8230;. It&#8217;s just not my week, heck it&#8217;s not my month, my season, or my year.</p>

        <p>Last night my phone was acting up worse then ever before. Every time would attempt to dial it would hangup, and when the battery died, it would simply refuse to charge, I plugged it in for hours, it never charged. At about 2:30 I tried to open the phone to try it once again and I heard a snap sound, I saw a piece fly up and the phone fell in half, it&#8217;s horrible.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Today I went down to the Verizon Wireless store where I found out that I have apparently been paying for an insurance policy on my telephone along with my phone service. I went to the bank and transferred enough money between accounts to cover the $50 deductable, then I came home and called the claims number. They apparently did not have a T720 in stock so they decided to set me up with a different &#8220;comparable&#8221; phone.</p>

<p>They are setting me up with an LG VX-4400. I went to <a href="http://www.phonesnoop.com/">PhoneSnoop</a> and compared the LG-4400 to a T720 to see what I&#8217;m getting.</p>

<p>It seems that the insurance policy also covers my car charger (that has been broken ever since I visited Tennessee back in September) so not only am I getting a new cell phone but a new car charger as well, which is good, since this is a different brand of phone and even if the charger wasn&#8217;t broken, it wouldn&#8217;t work with this phone anyway.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I of course have to wait for overnight shipping. Since it is Sunday and they cannot ship on Sunday, they will ship it overnight tomorrow which means I will receive my phone on Tuesday, so tomorrow I&#8217;m without a phone, as I was today. Below you will find a table comparing my current phone (T720) with the new one (LG-4400).</p>

<p><em>Table removed as it was not Valid XHTML</em><br />
There will be a few concessions of course, but overall I think the new phone will be better then my old one. I spent some time scrolling through the first 4 pages of reviews on the 4400 and in all that there was only one bad review, the rest were all extremely positive, and most specifically said it was better then the T720, so I&#8217;m looking forward to receiving it Tuesday.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be going back to the District Office to finish up a few tasks involved in stabilizing their new server.</p>

        <p>Well John posted an entry in his blog pointing out that he is the only one of all his friends who faithfully posts in his blog every day. I guess that makes me a slacker.</p>

<p>Much has happened in the last several days so let&#8217;s get cracking. First of all, I would like to thank my Imzadi for posting such a beautiful poem about love. Darling I love reading that poem, it brings a little tear to my eye each time I read it, which has been several times.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This morning I was finally able to get my application to become a Microsoft partner was approved and I was able to redeem my TS2 certificate to get my copy of Office 2003, I look forward to finding out how becoming a Microsoft partner can increase the revenue stream for my business. Running A/V for the whole church Sunday morning actually went pretty well, only a few small glitches, I look forward to the next time I&#8217;m allowed to run sound for the Sunday service.</p>

<p>Monday and Tuesday I didn&#8217;t get much done, and by Tuesday night I was feeling useless. The Upside of both days is I spent much of each day talking to my Imzadi on the phone. I love talking to her and I&#8217;ve gotten to talk to her a lot this week, I&#8217;m really glad for that.</p>

<p>Today however was pretty productive. I got up in the morning and got on-line, it was then that I noticed that I got the e-mail back from Partner Support that they have manually approved my application and given me the authorization code since the automated system didn&#8217;t work, I got my software ordered and then I drove to the District/Church office. I walked into the District office first and talked with Iris who was mentioning the competency levels of the Computer consulting firm that they employ to maintain their server. More on that later. Then I went in to the church office and went to fixing Chris Moore&#8217;s computer, which had an odd problem in it. For no apparent reason several important files in Windows 98 vanished without a trace. Files like EMM386.exe, HiMem.sys, and&#8230;. Win.com</p>

<p>In attempt to fix it himself, Chris has installed Windows 2000 since he couldn&#8217;t get the Windows 98 CD to boot (they don&#8217;t often do that). He installed Windows 2000 but did a full install not an upgrade install and was confused why all his program shortcuts and such were gone, and more importantly why he couldn&#8217;t install MS Office on the system. The reason he couldn&#8217;t install Office was of course that Office requires that you install the 2000 Service Packs first. I brought my handy dandy Security Updates CD and got him all up to date and installed Office for them.</p>

<p>After I got done in there I went back to the District Office where I was informed that the district was completely fed up with the current Computer Consulting firm they have hired to maintain their network and that I should submit a resumé and a proposal for a price structure and they would strongly consider hiring my company to maintain their network as opposed to this company that is costing them a fortune and not doing their jobs.</p>

        <p><em>(This is a retroactive post, this post is written from the perspective of the day it occurred, Saturday, but was not posted until Sunday)</em></p>

<p>Well today was filled with job opportunities, <a href="2004-03-27-great-depression">Depression</a>, and surprising requests. The day began when I was checking on the status of the family computer and checking some e-mails and the Metadot website. The reason I had gone to the <a href="http://www.metadot.com/">Metadot website</a> was to check to see if there had been any comments concerning the plug-in I had posted to Metadot Friday night. Friday night before going to <a href="2004-03-26-evermore">Evermore CD Release Party</a>, I quickly posted a <a href="http://www.metadot.com/metadot/index.pl?iid=9153&amp;isa=Category">plug-in</a> I had written for the Metadot Portal Server that creates both RSS and Java-Script news-feeds for any channel stored in the Metadot for inclusion in other websites.</p>

<p>Anyway I was browsing this site quickly before I went with my Dad to see David&#8217;s play (mentioned <a href="2004-03-27-great-depression">earlier</a>) I noticed that at some point Friday they had posted a job opening on their website for a Perl Developer, with a little puzzle to get it started, As many of you know, I have <a href="2004-02-28-road-warrior">visited the Metadot corporation headquarters</a> last month. when I began my search for a job that has been almost exactly a month long now.</p>

<p>In other related news, My mother was asking me this morning if I could contact the person with DotSpot Internet Service in Tennessee and ask them if it is possible to meet with them on a Saturday rather then a weekday, I&#8217;m assuming because she is thinking of going to Tennessee with me to facilitate that possible job interview. I told her I would contact them to see if that is a possibility.</p>

<p>When I was about to enter the theater to watch David&#8217;s Play I got a call on my cell phone from Mr E asking me if I would be willing to run Sound tomorrow morning. I told him I would be happy to but that I am a little nervous about it, I&#8217;ve never run sound for a Sunday Morning before and was a tad nervous about it.</p>

<p>So David came home late this evening, apparently his school won a few awards but apparently did not win the overall competition. David got an &#8220;All Star Cast&#8221; award (apparently it means he was the best in his production), he was also second place for best Actor overall (someone from Martin High won). One of the girls in his school&#8217;s cast won best Actress. They placed third place as far as their play itself is concerned.</p>

        <p><em>(This is a retroactive post, this post is written from the perspective of the day it occurred, Saturday, but was not posted until Sunday)</em></p>

<p>This is a story about depression, but unlike previous posts about depression, this depression has absolutely nothing to do with me. I&#8217;m talking about the Great Depression of the 1930s. I say I&#8217;m talking about it, I should be saying the play my brother was just in was talking about it.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Today my brother was at Martin High School along with several other schools to compete in the UIL One Act Play 2004 acting competition for District 5A-7, the play his school selected was</p>

<p><em><strong>&#8220;The American Clock&#8221;</strong></em> by Arthur Miller (Produced through special arrangement by Dramatists Play Service). David played the part of Lee Baum, a lad with high aspirations to write for a newspaper who&#8217;s dreams are shattered by the Great Depression.</p>

<p>David&#8217;s school did their perform ace first so after David was done with his part of the program, Dad and I left, rather then watch the other 6 schools do their performances which would have kept us there all the way who knows how long. The play was good but as Dad and I were leaving the theater dad said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;That was good, kind of depressing though&#8221;<br />
  To which I answered &#8220;What do you expect from a play about the Great Depression&#8221;<br />
  &#8220;Oh is that why they call it the depression?&#8221; he answered back sarcastically.<br />
  &#8220;DUH!&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good play, I&#8217;ll have to check out to see if there&#8217;s a longer version available, this seemed rather short and condensed.</p>

<p>One thing that struck me was the location. Martin&#8217;s auditorium is not as nice as Seguin&#8217;s (David&#8217;s School) where I&#8217;ve seen his previous plays. The chairs are older, an ugly shade of orange, and very very small, I felt like I was sitting in a grade school auditorium rather then a high school&#8217;s. No consideration for fat people such as myself at all, how annoying.</p>

        <p><em>(This is a retroactive post, this post is written from the perspective of the day it occurred on Friday but was not posted until Sunday)</em></p>

<p>This evening I attended the Official CD Release Party of <a href="http://www.theevermore.com/">The Evermore Project</a> at <a href="http://www.cafefriday.net/">Cafe Friday</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><a href="http://www.cafefriday.net/">Cafe Friday</a> is an interesting and unusual ministry of <a href="http://www.tcab.org/">The Church At Burleson</a> involving a coffee shop style environment with live musical guests and a unique message style. As I stated this week&#8217;s musical guest was <a href="http://www.theevermore.com">The Evermore Project</a>, a band of 4 of which 3 of the 4 band members plus the sound man for the group attend the same church I go to (<a href="http://www.edenroad.com/">Eden Road Community Church</a>) which was the reason I decided to go to Cafe Friday this evening. This was not just a normal concert for Evermore, but it was the official release party for their CD &#8220;Rain On Me.&#8221; (The CD can be purchased from <a href="http://www.deaconofnoise.com">Deacon Of Noise Records</a> a small record company owned and operated by Eliacim Cortez, the sound man for both Eden Road and The Evermore Project. Incidentally, I love the Deacon Of Noise logo even though it is not the general logo style I like:</p>

<p>Cafe Friday was an interesting environment, it all began with a video clip from <em>The Fighting Temptations</em> (a movie which I previously reviewed <a href="https://www.nick.pro/2003/09/21/conference-visits-cuba/">Here</a>) where Cuba Gooding Jr.&#8217;s character is in church for a funeral and his cell phone rings, the pastor of the church says &#8220;Son if that isn&#8217;t Jesus calling, turn it off.&#8221; So already the mood was set light just from the clip they played to tell people to turn their phones off. Then The Evermore got up, and I&#8217;ve seen these guys several times, but this night they were exceptionally good. My dad also agreed that they sounded better tonight then we&#8217;ve ever heard them. It also turned out to be Pedro&#8217;s (the drummer for both Evermore and ERCC as well as a good friend of David and I&#8217;s) Birthday.</p>

<p>The teaching time was interesting, it was interrupted twice, first for an funny little video clip of the speaker putting on a karate uniform and then being beat up by a Karate expert. The segment was funny but was shot in fast motion, so it would have been more funny with either cheesy Batman style &#8220;WHAMO&#8221; and &#8220;FWAP&#8221; blurbs or doing the whole thing in sepia tones making it like a silent picture, or&#8230; since it was Karate, could have done it with bad voice dubbing like a Martial Arts movie. The point of the segment was to illustrate that just because he put on the karate uniform, didn&#8217;t mean he knew karate; so many people put on the costume of a good christian, but when faced with issues, they don&#8217;t know how to act as a Christian should.</p>

<p>Anyway after more of his message they paused again for a little skit about how people who don&#8217;t spend time with Jesus end up trying to leave him behind and not carry Him with them as they go about their daily lives.</p>

<p>After the remainder of the message Evermore got back up and finished their set. Got home after 11, quite late but it was a fun evening non-the-less.</p>

        <p>I spent Tuesday at a Regal Cinemas in Fort Worth where I was attending 2 Microsoft Seminars. The first one was TouchPoint and the second was TS2. TouchPoint&#8217;s purpose was for small business owners and workers to find out what MS Office 2003 and Windows Small Business Server 2003 can do for them. TS2 was for IT Professionals and was far more interesting. They showed how these advanced functions actually worked, as well as explain to me how my business can make money selling and servicing Microsoft Products.</p>

<p>In the TouchPoint event I won a door prize of a pen that the bottom half of the pen is one of those &#8220;space pens&#8221; that supposedly writes upside down and underwater and all that, and the top of the pen unscrews to reveal a USB Pen-drive. Coupled with all the nifty Microsoft parting gifts I was given on the way out of each event it was a pretty nice day.</p>

<p>I have officially resigned from ACTD last night, I&#8217;m going to miss the game but I really feel I need to get my professional life back together before I can think about things like playing games on-line. The past couple months ACTD has only added stress to my already stress-filled life, and ACTD is a game, it&#8217;s supposed to be a stress buster not a stress multiplier. Hopefully I can come back to the game soon, after I get some other aspects of my life back on track</p>

<p>My Imzadi still hasn&#8217;t received her Phone, but I figured it would come either Wednesday or Thursday so it should be arriving tomor&#8230; er today, wow it&#8217;s 1:30 in the morning, I better get some sleep I have a lot of work to do today. Goodnight.</p>

        <p><em>Note in May 2006 &#8211; Once again I find an article that has been edited by my ex, I am not sure what was in the beginning of this article before, but I&#8217;m sure it was an article about my trip to Arkansas with the SWD to a Team Leadership Conference.  It was a very nice article about what the conference was about, communicating.  I am quite annoyed to find it removed.</em></p>

<p>In other news, this past week I received a letter from Gail Hallman, who is now ERCC&#8217;s Administrative Director now that Jim Cantleberry is having to leave the church, assigning me to clean the church in a specific time-slot, without ever asking me if I was willing or able to serve in this regard</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I wrote her an e-mail yesterday to express this concern</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Greetings Gail,</p>
  
  <p>I am greatly disturbed by the manner in which this new clean team drafting process is being handled. If you had come to me and said &#8220;Nick, the clean team does not have enough people on it, would you consider joining the team&#8221; I would have considered it, with my other responsibilities, and I probably would have said yes. But you have not given me that option. We are coming off of a series in church called Simplifying LIFE and one of the main tenants in this series has been that we carefully consider taking on new responsibilities in our lives.</p>
  
  <p>Several separate messages specifically said that we as a people learn to be able to say no and not take on new responsibilities so quickly.</p>
  
  <p>You know from experience that I greatly enjoy helping the church in any way I can, it gives me great joy to know I&#8217;ve been of help in some way, but I do not appreciate that when there is a need that it be taken for granted that I will help fill that need, and I&#8217;m sure I am not the only one to think this way.</p>
  
  <p>I have always been happy to stay after an event to help straighten up for the next event, but being told that I must appear at the church on a particular date and help because it&#8217;s the day I&#8217;ve been arbitrarily assigned to without even being asked if I was willing to help in the first place is not right.</p>
  
  <p>I am disturbed in a broader sense that the church has not even limited this draft to the membership of Eden Road but by your own words &#8220;among all the regular attenders.&#8221; People are being drafted to do a specific task in the church without their consent and they aren&#8217;t even sure they want to be members of the church yet?</p>
  
  <p>Because of how much this disturbs me I do not feel that I can easily do this task and maintain a mentality of love throughout it. I have therefore decided to exercise the lesson learned in recent teachings at Eden Road and respectfully say No, I cannot take on this task. I will gladly continue to stay after events and help setup for whatever is coming next if possible for me to do so, but I cannot come to the church at 9 o&#8217;clock in the morning on April 17th.</p>
  
  <p>VR<br />

        <p>Lately I&#8217;ve been feeling like I&#8217;m completely unwanted.

<p>I hate the feeling of rejection, well of course I do, everyone hates rejection, but rejection has always been something I have struggled with. Also feelings of failure. In case you are wondering why I haven&#8217;t posted any blog entries in the last week and a half, well besides the fact that I&#8217;ve been very busy, I just don&#8217;t feel that anything I&#8217;m doing is worth a blog entry.</p>

        <p>Saturday my family and I watched a movie on DVD called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325258/combined">Dickie Roberts &#8211; Former Child Star</a>. The movie started kinda slow and so my mom quickly lost interest. And overall it's probably not all that good of a comedy, but it did have some very hilarious scenes in it.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Dad really got a kick out of recognizing all the former child star cameo roles in the film. I didn't really recognize most of them, but the ones I did recognize made for some interesting viewing. The funniest part of the movie had to be the end credits however. The filmmakers decided to gather absolutely every child star they could get their hands on and shoved them into the same room to perform a song about how much these former child stars are sick of being referred to as such. Verses like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People say I'm not as cute<br />
  as the Dennis the Mennis I used to be<br />
  Well I guess I just forgot not to get older<br />
  Silly Me</p>
  
  <p>He's got a point<br />
  aging happens to everyone<br />
  but it probably wouldn't have hurt him<br />
  to stay out of the sun</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And my personal favorite line in the song:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't say &#8220;Hey didn't you used to be&#8221; or I'll stick your head through a Vintage TV</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was so funny I had to go to the special features on the DVD and watch the full screen extended version of the song too. Anyway, it's not exactly a movie I'm going to go out and buy to keep around, but it was definitely worth the rent and I may rent it again someday to see it again.</p>

<p>One big nitpick though, there was this scene where the young girl and her &#8220;arch rival&#8221; were both trying out for pep squad or something like that. The rival, who is of course this 9/10 year old girl, did this dance routine to &#8220;I wanna be Bad&#8221; that was very very&#8230; very very not what a 9/10 year old should be doing, or anybody for that matter, yikes!</p>

        <p>As most of you have probably figured out by now, i suck at graphical interfaces, and as part of that, I can't create a good looking template, I compensate for my lack of creative juices by making my sites and blog do as much as humanly possible. Unlike my friends like <a href="http://www.jmaclabs.com">JMac</a> and <a href="http://www.andymatter.com/">Andy</a> who actually have decent looking sites, mine is ugly but does as much as possible. The latest plug-in I installed? A Plug-in to generate animated maps automatically, like this one, which shows a pan from my<br />
home to mid Tennessee (A Trip I've done before that I'm just dying to duplicate as soon as possible). Plug-ins are<br />
fun, I should look into writing a few of my own, rather then just modifying the ones made by others to tweak them the way I want them.</p>

        <p>Many of those of you who know me know and tease me about the fact that I hate driving. I don't know why some people (e.g. JMac, who drives just for the sake of driving) love driving so much, it causes me physical pain. I really should get a car with cruise control or something so it doesn't hurt so much, but after driving for a while my right heel hurts bad and generally I feel bad for being so cramped in the car, I just don't like it. That said, Yesterday I got up early, after my shower got dressed as nicely as possible, and then drove down to Austin, TX to meet with the creators of the Metadot Portal Server.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>One of the primary reasons I don't like driving is probably because I have a terrible sense of direction, and Mapquest directions sometimes suck&#8230; bigtime. This was no exception. First of all, the directions involved getting on I-35 South, taking an exit and going down US81 South, only to have it merge directly back into I-35 South again a couple hours later. This was silly and I'm not sure why I didn't pay enough attention to the overall directions to realize it earlier and just stay on I-35, it would have probably been much faster considering US-81 goes through several towns and every time it hits a town it drops down from the 70mph between towns to 30mph inside it, sometimes with stop signs and traffic lights to deal with as well.</p>

<p>Also, while traveling down US-81, I got caught behind moving houses. Yes I said house<strong>s</strong>, plural. Not once, not twice, but three times did i get stuck behind a slowly moving house being moved to wherever it was going.</p>

<p>Furthering the topic of bad directions from Mapquest, Mapquest told me to exit I-35 South and take <code>N MO PAC EXWAY</code>, not only is this a horrible abbreviation of what the street's name is, but this street doesn't exist, or at least, there is no road sign anywhere that I could find that had <code>MO PAC</code> anywhere on it. After calling Metadot explaining I was lost and what I was looking for, they told me that the road had at least 4 other names, and I was eventually able to find it by one of those names and go through all the other surface streets to eventually reach FM 2222 which is the road on which Metadot's Headquarters can be found. After my meeting they gave me directions to get back to I-35 and guess what, FM 2222 leads right to I-35, so when Mapquest gave me directions that said exit I-35 and take all these other surface streets to get to FM 2222, one of which doesn't have that name, they could have saved me a whole lot of time and frustration and just say exit I-35 at FM 2222.</p>

<p>The meeting with Metadot went rather well overall, although they don't have a position available for me to work for them at this time, they did say that they often have too much work for their programmers to do alone and that they will send me some consulting projects to help them out. It was fun getting to meet the people who wrote the software that I work with day after day. I got to meet Daniel G, and Cory K, whom I've known their names from the Metadot forums, but meeting them face to face and talking to them was a real treat. After spending some time talking to Daniel and taking the grand tour, I sat down with Cory and he gave me the insider tour of the newest version of Metadot. Man Metadot has some really cool new features, I just hope that I can get them all implemented on my sites because they really are quite amazing some of them.</p>

<p>Anyway driving home was a lot easier, I drove FM 2222 up to I-35 and drove along the service road until I found a place to eat (Applebees, where I had steak, salmon, and stuffed poppers, YUM!) and then I started up I-35, which was slow at first because I was in Austin and it was rush hour, but once I got away from the city it sped back up.</p>

<p>Right around 7 o'clock I started getting sleepy, so I pulled over to a rest area and took about a 45 minute nap, then I bought an ice cream bar and coke at the vending machines and then kept on driving. I stopped at another picnic area at 9:20 to quickly call my Girlfriend and talked to her for about a half hour before continuing my way home. I would have talked longer but I no longer have a car charger for my cell phone and I wanted to make sure I had plenty of battery power in case of an emergency driving home. I arrived home right about 11:50 p.m. and talked on the phone again, giving both <a href="http://www.JmacLabs.com/">JMac</a> and <a href="https://mike.johnson.pro">MrGoo</a> a recap of the events of the day before going to sleep.</p>

<p>One last note about yesterday, Before leaving Arlington I picked up 2 Pepsi's and a Coke to drink on the way, and Both Pepsi's were iTunes winners (cool for me since none of the Pepsi's I had bought previously had won), so&#8230;</p>

<p>[iTunes is now playing <strong>If We Are the Body</strong> by <strong>Casting Crowns</strong> (Album: Casting Crowns) (3:59)]</p>

        <p>This record is of the events of Thursday, February 26th. Shortly after I got up on Thursday I received a call from my father telling me he was planning on taking off from work early and that he was going to go with me over to Metrotime to be my witness so I can go and get my stuff out of the grips of Harold.</p>

<p>As I was getting ready I almost wore my WCW shirt because of what he had said in his reply to my letter: <em>&#8220;Go back to WCW with my blessing.&#8221;</em> I decided against it however and wore one of my normal pullover shirts. I did make sure and in the box of the few things I had of Metrotime's, I placed the Metrotime shirt that he had given me at one point.<br />
<!--more--></p>

<p>Against my better judgment I called Metrotime at Dad's suggestion to make sure he was there, Harold did not answer the phone. When I told Dad that he didn't answer the phone we decided to go anyway. The reason I said against my better judgment is that I didn't want to give Harold the &#8220;Head's Up&#8221; in the first place. I thought catching him off guard would be better.</p>

<p>Harold was there when we arrived and I quickly boxed up my few possessions and climbed up on the roof to remove my Satellite Dish from the makeshift radio tower we had built on the roof. Harold of course still holds to the theory that I owe him over $750. Like the 2 months of work for no pay and the fact that I have taken over web hosting for his clients, even the ones that had prepaid him for an entire year of service and were now getting their service from me for the remaining periods of their contracts don't have any effect on what he thinks I owe him.</p>

<p>I decided not to get into an argument and instead stated as calmly as possible that since I had not been paid in over 2 months I would simply have to pay him back after I got on my feet working for a company that actually pays it's employees and after I fixed the other debt incurred during that period of time.</p>

<p>Simply put, Harold is an asshole. I normally refrain from swearing at all, and especially in written form, but it's the truth. Harold is a complete and utter Jerk. He went on and on about how I didn't call one of his customers Tuesday or Wednesday. <strong><em>Newsflash</em></strong> Harold, by the time I got up on Tuesday, You had fired me!!!! Why should I call your customers and give them free support AFTER you fired me?!</p>

<p>After this I went over to Pastor Tom's office on the other side of the building and tried to fix his printer for him, but try as I might I couldn't do it, so since Dad was with me and I didn't want to take up too much of Dad's time, I decided to leave and come back to it on Monday. While I was trying though I did have a rather nice conversation with Dad about my immediate goals and plans.</p>

<p>When I got home I dropped Dad off and quickly went over to the new <a title="Christian Brother's Automotive" href="http://www.christianbrothersauto.com/" target="_blank">Christian Brother's Automotive</a> near the house that was running a $14.95 special on Oil Changes and since it had probably been almost 5000 miles since my last Oil Change and I was going to put over 400 miles on the car on Friday, I figured I should probably get an oil change. Thankfully although they were technically closed they were still there and said they'd go ahead and do my car. Very nice people there, and a nice lobby, however&#8230; They have a really ugly website, and I mean a REALLY ugly website. Cheesy page transitions, bad rollovers, they really need someone to do an overhaul on that website. It's about as unprofessional as they come.</p>

<p>After the the oil change I went home to start getting ready for my trip Friday morning. I was in my room when my cell phone rang. It was that same customer I had mentioned earlier in this entry. They were complaining again, and I felt sorry for them and drove over to the middle of Fort Worth at 10:30 at night to fix their dang computers because they thought it was from something I did. In actuality some software they had installed was the culprit that had stopped their computer from working.</p>

<p>After much work I was able to get all their computers working again and tried to make it as clear as possible that I didn't work for Harold and should not under any circumstances have come out there at 10:30 at night to fix their computers for free, that I did it out of the goodness of my heart and that they should not expect it to happen again. I don't know if they understood or not, but I hope they did because I'd hate to have to tell them again. I nearly missed my chance to talk to the one I loved because of this. When I came on-line she was just about to leave because I had not shown up, in fact the seemed to be in the process of leaving, but instead talked to me for a while.</p>

<p>It was indeed a rather difficult day&#8230;</p>

        <p>One of the side effects of having a blog and having friends who have blogs, not to mention the whole being jobless thing, is that as I surf around the blogs of friends I find that they are up to far more interesting things then I am&#8230; Take <a href="http://www.andymatter.com/">Andy</a> for example, I was reading the last few entries of his blog today and apparently he is working on a <a href="http://www.andymatter.com/blog/archives/000247.php">Minesweeper Thesis</a>, how fun is that? The idea is to come up with the mathematical probabilities of winning at Minesweeper, he&#8217;s got a chart and everything.</p>

<p>I need an interesting project to work on&#8230;. Oh well&#8230;</p>

        <p>I was just watching <a href="http://www.techlive.com/">TechLive</a>, not really paying attention while I worked on trying to diagnose memory leaks on a server but something they said caught my ear. They were talking about Cattle Rangling (Stealing Cattle) and mentioned the new technology they are using to stop them. They mentioned that the culprit was caught and charged with several counts of &#8220;<em>Grand Theft of Cow</em>.&#8221; I just had to post that, it was such a weird statement.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;ve spent the last few hours installing a number of plugins for MT.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The first couple plugins effect the index pages. The first is the now dynamic copyright statement on the home page of the site, it will update as time goes on. It does the copyright based on the year of the first entry and the year of the last entry, so since my first entry was in 2003 and my last entry (as of this post) was in 2004 the copyright statement reads ©2003-2004.</p>

<p>the next can currently be seen below the copyright statement until I design a better template to decide where to put it. It shows what movies I currently have checked out in my Netflix account, very cool dynamic feature.</p>

<p>The next two have to do with automatic formatting of blog entries. The first of the 2 looks for acronyms like <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</abbr>, <abbr title="MovableType">MT</abbr>, <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr>, <abbr title="A Call To Duty">ACTD</abbr>, <abbr title="America Online">AOL</abbr>, and more and makes them into acronym tags (try putting your cursor over those acronyms if they are showing up underlined. If they don&#8217;t show up underlined that means that your browser doesn't support <code>&lt;acronym&gt;</code> tags.</p>

<p>The second creates automatic links to bible verses. When I type in <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jhn.3.16">John 3:16</a> you should see a link to that bible verse, and <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jhn.11.35">John 11:35</a> and <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/est.8.9">Esther 8:9</a> and <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.23">Psalm 23</a></p>

<p>These modules should make my blog a lot more exciting. I can&#8217;t wait to load some more!</p>

        <p>I didn't mention this yesterday but I am now using a new client for MT called <a target="_blank" title="Zempt" href="http://zempt.org/">Zempt</a> to update this blog.</p>

<p>This is a great program, <a href="http://www.jmaclabs.com/">JMac</a> pointed this program out to me saying it is what he favors using on windows. I must agree. Nothing against w.bloggar but it just didn't support everything that zempt does.</p>

<p>In other news, I've gone through all my old blog entries and renamed all of the entries that had a title like &#8220;Personal Log &#8211; Stardate&#8230;&#8221;, first of all that's dorky, and second of all I think titles should be understandable, I mean I may want to go back and find a blog entry one day, if I don't name the entries with logical names that may become difficult. I've also done some changes to the categories for future category logging.</p>

        <p><em>Note &#8211; May 2006 &#8211; This is the third blog entry I have found in my editing of my blog that has been edited by my ex-girlfriend trying to remove the header of the message.  This post used to be a lovely reminder of the high point of my relationship with her, which despite the horrible endings and how vindictive and mean she became after the relationship ended, I still would like to remember the good times.  Plus this post was written on a day when I was very sick and about to lose my job and yet it was a message of a day that was actually kind of nice.</em><br />
<!--more--></p>

<p>I was woken up at 5:30 in the afternoon by my mother calling me as she entered the house saying I had 2 packages on the front porch waiting for me. They were both from my Girlfriend containing gifts she had sent me. She sent me 3 stuffed bears, a framed picture of herself, a wallet sized version of the same picture, a Valentines Day Card, a letter, and a poem that she wrote. It really warmed my heart to receive these gifts of her love. I love you Imzadi, more each and every day.</p>

<p>I need to build a shelf over my piano to place these tokens of her love so that I can look at them from my bed and remember her love (except for the wallet sized picture, which I'll keep with me)</p>

<p>Later when I finally opened up my laptop I was doing my normal rounds through my various e-mail accounts and noticed something in my main ACTD e-mail account. It was a notification that my character Lieutenant Junior Grade Cap (Bynar) was promoted to the rank of full Lieutenant. At the time of the actual game on the Scorpius my character didn't have that much to do during the mission but there was a nice brief ceremony following the mission when his promotion was noted.</p>

<p>Plus I'm back to blogging, this being my second blog entry of the day (although it's now 2:22 a.m. so it's really a new day) so all in all, it's been a very nice day.</p>

        <p>Well I was looking at JM's Blog and I determined that I really should update my blog more often. I was also thinking about something that had happened to me this week and thought that perhaps if I had been writing down my thoughts, they might not have boiled to the point they did this week.</p>

<p>It all started Last Friday, not Friday yesterday, but the Friday before. I was already stressed out because of a number of factors in my life that I will not go into detail again here because I've said the big ones before. I'll just list the factors starting Friday that led me to my nervous breakdown on Tuesday.
<!--more--></p>

<p>As almost all of the few people who are likely to read this blog entry know, one of the biggest escapes from the stress of life I have is <a href="http://www.acalltoduty.com/">ACTD</a>, a text (IRC) based Star Trek RPG. I play on 2 ships, one on Friday nights at 7, the other on Saturday nights at 7. On Friday night I was playing my Betazoid character, Lieutenant Victor Scott Regnum, on the U.S.S. Artemis NCC-83093. Well in the game we encountered strange aliens that traveled through space in ships made of coral propelled by black holes for engines. This alien had not attacked us or done anything aggressive with the exception of coming toward us. Personally I don't consider this aggressive, but instead of doing everything we could to meet these aliens, the CO (Captain) of the Artemis commanded us to run away from them. My character spoke up and said that it doesn't make sense that we are running instead of trying to &#8220;seek out new life and new civilizations.&#8221; Well the Captain didn't like my frankness and kicked me off the bridge, relieving me of duty. So even in my gaming things were not going well for me.</p>

<p>Saturday was supposed to be the most romantic day of the year (Valentines Day). And for the first time in my entire life I've had someone to call my Valentine on Valentines day, but because of my financial situation not only could I not visit her for Valentines Day, but I couldn't even afford to send her flowers. I spent the day alone and sad. I did call her that night and talked to her for quite a while. And later that evening I did some financial transfers to transfer enough money into one account to buy her an inexpensive necklace which I purchased for her, but I was still depressed that I couldn't be with her.</p>

<p>Sunday I was at the church running powerpoint and lighting for the youth group. Once a month instead of our normal worship we have the College &amp; Career worship band lead worship for us. Well the leaders of this group, as well as several of the members, have been bugging me for months to get me to join their group. Every time they have a function they bug me to come to it. I don't really want to, I'm not good in groups, I'm not a social person. Heck at church I lock myself in a box (the sound booth) and only ever talk to 1 or 2 people at a time, I just don't like groups. Well they just kept bugging and bugging me to join them after the youth group to eat ice cream, so I went, and what did I do there? Well after eating my ice cream of course, I ended up sitting in a corner by myself.</p>

<p>Monday was a very long and hard day. I worked hard through the day on various projects and then I stayed at the office all night working. I got home at 7:30 Tuesday morning and made something quick to eat (having not eaten since lunch the day before). I got to my bed shortly before 8 and was about to lie down and get some much needed rest when mom came into my room with the phone cause Harold had called. There he was rattling off a list of things I simply HAD to get done today and I listened and paid attention and then when he finally let me go I hung up and went to sleep.</p>

<p>Less then 2 hours later I was woken up by the phone ringing. If I had been more awake I would have ignored it, but like a fool I answered it thinking it would be Harold again. It wasn't.. It was the collection agency calling threatening me about the Bank Of America account I had never authorized again. This was the meanest person I've talked to concerning this matter. I mean she was a real b&#42;***. Any meaner and she would have been saying &#8220;If you don't pay us in 24 hours we will curse you and your entire family to eternal damnation&#8221; They did say 24 hours, but they just said &#8220;horrible things&#8221; they didn't say eternal damnation.</p>

<p>So I was already pretty fried from no sleep and that, well 45 seconds after I hung up with the queen B, the guy Harold had called to climb up on the billboards called my cell phone. He said I needed to be at the billboard on Cooper street immediately. So I threw on some clothes and zipped over to Cooper street. Not only was I already stressed but I hadn't had my shower, Showers relax me and I take a shower every day before leaving the house.</p>

<p>At the billboard we spent the next few hours trying to get a signal from our other billboard on I20. It was an supposed to be an EASY wireless shot.</p>

<p>For those of you who don't understand this. The brown line is the terrain, the black lines going from the brown line up to the dark blue line on either side indicate the height of the billboards on each side, the dark blue line indicates the actual wireless shot, and the red and green curves indicate the Fresnel zone. This shot is only 5.8 miles so distance isn't a problem, and the red line and dark blue line never cross through the brown line so terrain isn't a problem. Yet try as I might I simply could not get a signal out of it. And I'm not talking, the signal was weak, I'm talking there was <strong>NO</strong> signal whatsoever.</p>

<p>This threw me over the edge. First my left hand started to twitch, then shake uncontrollably. It wouldn't stop, I kept grabbing my left hand with my right hand just to stop it from shaking. Then I started stuttering, no matter what I was saying I was stuttering. Then what I was saying stopped making sense. I started analyzing everything that was going wrong, and then as I was audibly talking about them they started mixing up, I started mixing up the wireless problems with the financial problems with the love problems with the ACTD problems, just mixing everything up.</p>

<p>Then I started seeing things, more specifically I saw numbers, everywhere I saw numbers floating around. I rode this nervous breakdown for several hours before I finally calmed down, it was frightening.</p>

<p>So this breakdown is the main reason I've decided perhaps I should update this blog more. I feel that if I organize my problems and the good things that happen to me in blog entries perhaps it will help keep me from getting to that point again. This is the second nervous breakdown I've had in my life, I really don't want to have anymore.</p>

<p>Later that night when I called D I found out she got the pendant I sent her and she thanked me saying she really liked it, so that really brought up my mood.</p>

<p>Wednesday I didn't go to work at all, feeling I needed the day to recover from my breakdown. Thursday I had a job to do for a company in Fort Worth, networking their computers together. And Friday I worked from the house on various projects.</p>

<p>Last night I was up till about 3:30 in the morning working on various projects and talking to my Imzadi on-line and I forgot to set my alarm before going to sleep, so I was woken up at 5:30 in the afternoon by my mom calling me. I'll write about the events of today in a separate entry.</p>

        <p>Over a 2 months&#8230;. That&#8217;s a very long time since my last blog entry. Both the blog server and the client I use to write my blogs have been updated in this time, and not a single message from me. This should be the first indication on how stressful my life has become as of late. It is difficult to understand how things can both be better then ever and worse then ever at the same time, but I will try to explain.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I will start with the good. My personal life has never been better. As my previous entries indicate, I have fallen in love. Every day I love my Imzadi more, and she loves me too. I oh so long for the next time I can visit her. My self esteem and emotional states have never been higher.</p>

<p>But nothing is ever perfect&#8230; Financially and Professionally I have reached new lows in my life. I have been working longer and harder on a steady incline for the past several months. Last week I put in over 75 hours working, yet I haven&#8217;t been paid at all since mid December. This lack of income has resulted in my biggest financial slump of my life.</p>

<p>A Major financial institution (Bank of America) is threatening to sue me on a regular basis if I don&#8217;t pay what they say I owe them in full. Speaking of which, Bank of America set me up with a credit card account I never signed up for and then let it get charged up without my authorization and then would not work with me on it, so if I can ever dig myself out of this hole you can be sure BofA will NEVER get any of my money in the future. They don&#8217;t deserve it.</p>

<p>The biggest annoyance of this financial difficulty is that I cannot visit my Imzadi. Our relationship is unfortunately long distance right now and I long to visit her so much it hurts. D, if you read this, I&#8217;m so sorry that my visit to you has been delayed so long. I hope to visit you again as soon as humanly possible. I love you always.</p>

<p>On further updates from my last blog entry, there are 5 chapters in the FFX2 and because I&#8217;ve been so busy I haven&#8217;t even beaten Chapter 2 yet.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;ve been working hard mostly on this wireless project. We now have the main transmitter and one repeater fully functional, we have our 2nd repeater nearly ready to be in operation and should be finishing our 3rd repeater within the next couple weeks, hopefully we can start getting clients online and then we can start generating some revenue so that perhaps I can get paid again&#8230; I hope&#8230;.</p>

<p>Tonight I went to the premier of my brother&#8217;s play. He was in a play entitled <strong>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</strong>, which was quite entertaining. I hope I&#8217;ll get to see it again, but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll have the time. His next performance is tomorrow but I will be at church helping with a lock-in for the youth group. He has another performance Saturday but I will probably be too tired after the lock-in and I have other commitments anyway. There&#8217;s another performance on Monday, perhaps I&#8217;ll be able to attend that one, I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>Well I need to get some sleep and then some more work done, so I&#8217;m going to go now, darn.. 4 a.m. where does the time go&#8230;.. Goodnight everybody.</p>

        <p>Note &#8211; May 2006 &#8211; As I am editing all of my blog entries I started to notice everything that she had wrecked, she destroyed anything in the Love category, which she obviously wasn't even looking at, because this article, which she tried to destroy had absolutely nothing to do with her, it was talking about games, music, and movies, none of which had anything to do with her.  She just likes destroying things that aren't hers.</em></p>

<p>[Listening to: What I Like About You &#8211; Lillix &#8211; Freaky Friday Soundtrack (02:47)]</p>

<p>I spent some time this afternoon hooking up my surround system that has sat boxed since I moved back to TX. So when I was done with that, what else could I do but&#8230; pop in a DVD and enjoy! After watching <em>The Santa Clause 2</em>, I spent a few hours enjoying <em>Final Fantasy X-2</em> in Dolby surround sound!</p>

<p>[Listening to: Ultimate &#8211; Track 01 &#8211; Lindsay Lohan &#8211; Freaky Friday (03:06)]</p>

<p>In case you can't tell I'm looking forward to the upcoming <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/liveaction/freakyfriday/html/index_flash.html?">Freaky Friday</a> DVD release by listening to the songs I had previously downloaded when the movie hit theaters.</p>

<p>[Listening to: Me Vs. The World &#8211; Halo Friendlies &#8211; Freaky Friday Soundtrack (03:48)]</p>

<p>After gaming with my PS2 for a while I went to the church youth group to work on my play and then watch a movie with the youth group. Tonight we watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0271582/ratings">Joshua</a>, a christian movie about what if Jesus came back today, how might he be received. A good movie as far as Christian movies go, practically no special effects at all but it didn't really need any. Ya should give it a try. It was pretty good.</p>

<p>Well that's all for tonight's post, gonna go finish playing with my gal and then go get some sleep, I have a very long day ahead of me in the morning.</p>

        <p>Well I'm slowly recovering from the flu. Last night after being caught in traffic for an excessive amount of time on I-20, I stopped at the Parks mall before heading home for the night. While there I paid up and picked up my previously reserved copy of <strong>Final Fantasy X-2</strong> for PS2. I then went downstairs and found my way to a cart that I had seen previously that sells personalized Veggitales CDs and picked one up in which the Veggitales will sing to my nephew Zach, figuring that will be a good christmas present for him. The lady at the card was nice enough to let me listen to it before purchasing it, and I chuckled as I heard <em>&#8220;If Zach likes to talk with Tomatoes, if a Squash can make you smile, if Zach likes to waltz with potatoes, up and down the produce aisle&#8230;&#8221;</em>. It was very funny and I'm sure my nephew will love it.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I then got a cheese-steak sandwich before driving home to try my long anticipated video game. I had seen japanese videos of the opening scene but the english version was slightly different. It was indeed a pop concert, but what struck me was how very <em>Charlie's Angels</em> the opening sequence was. When each of the 3 female lead characters were introduced we are taken to a screen showing just that character on a colorful background with their name, then when all 3 characters were together they strike attack poses and all 3 of them go over the colored background with Y R P on the bottom. The only thing missing was the Charlie's Angels theme song, although the music at that point in the game was of a similar style. Fortunately from that point on the only semblance to CA was the fact that the 3 main characters are female and they kick some butt.</p>

<p>I must say however if Brother and Yuna end up together by the end of the game I'm going to be pretty ticked! Brother has a very obvious crush on Yuna which he shows by excessive concern for her safety and a crazy desire to see her dance.</p>

<p>When my characters returned to Besaid (where the quest of FFX started) I was surprised to find out that Wakka and Lulu (2 main characters from FFX) had gotten together and that Lulu was pregnant, I wasn't expecting that at all.</p>

<p>At the end of my 5 hours of game-play last night the mini game of FFX-2 was introduced. It is not a card game like FF 7-9, nor is it a sporting event like FFX, instead it is a pretty complex number game that looks like it will be an interesting distraction throughout the game.</p>

<p>Anyway enough on the game for now, I'll write more when I know more of the story.</p>

<p>On to today, when I got to work this morning there was a CD waiting for me from <a href="http://www.lamar.com/">Lamar Advertising</a> containing the locations and specs (including height) of every billboard they own, something we have been waiting for, for a while now as it will help us plot which billboards we will use as repeater locations. I was able to find out that me and my partner have absolutely no ability to estimate how high things are. A billboard we estimated as 75 feet high was really 105 feet high, and one that we thought was 50 was 72, while one we thought was 60 was only 45, so our ability to estimate heights is incredibly inaccurate. I've spent the last several hours re-plotting some billboards we had previously estimated to see what the fresnel zones will cross at. Tedious work because when I run the LOS analysis I have to get it started and then sit and wait for an excessive amount of time for the computer to render a color coded map of what areas will have LOS and what areas will not. This is why I decided to write a BLOG entry while it was doing these renderings. Hopefully by the time I post this, the rendered map will be ready for viewing, if it isn't, perhaps it is a good time to take a lunch break (it is 2:46 p.m. after all and I haven't eaten a thing all day).</p>

<p>So that's all for now, I shall post more, when there is more to post.</p>

        <p>Well it has been well over a month since I last posted a log entry and that is because when I moved the SubspaceLink over to its new home I didn't copy over an important part of the Movable Type blog system, the database, and being lazy as I was I kept procrastinating when it came to doing it from that point on.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Well I've been suffering through the Flu for the past several days, yesterday and today were the worst and I'm really hoping I get better soon because this thing is killing me. Lying in bed for the past 2 days I spent the time this morning to copy over the missing part of MT and so now I'm writing a blog entry.</p>

<p>Much has happened in the last month and a half and I won't go into detail on all of it, but let's start with the biggest news. I'm in love! Because I'm not sure if my beloved wants me to talk much about it I won't tell you all here who she is or many details, but I will tell you that i had no idea what love truly felt like and I've never been happier. She is the first thing I think of when I wake up in the morning and the last thing I think of before I go to sleep. I could be having the absolute worst day possible and then she gives me a call and suddenly everything is going great. Even yesterday when my flu was at its worst, she called me in the morning and just talking to her made me feel better.</p>

<p>The Joint Venture I'm a part of is starting to come together nicely, I should get my FEIN for PortalKeeper, Inc. on Monday and the JV should be finalized by Tuesday. If we can reach our goal of 1500 customers by the end of February I should be able to move away from TX and do my work via correspondence and via business trips by March.</p>

<p>Well I'm gonna end this post for now, I'll post more later when I can remember more that has happened in the last month worth posting.</p>

        <p>It has been a very long week.</p>

<p>I was running the A/V system for the annual district conference of the Southwestern District of the C&amp;MA, long days but a lot of fun overall.
<!--more-->
Then Friday I took a quick trip out to TN to meet with D, a most enjoyable if sadly short encounter, flew there Friday afternoon, met her in the evening, and flew home Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Went to the movie theater last night and saw <em>The Fighting Temptations</em>, was pretty good but I felt a bit out of place as I was the only white guy in the theater, although there were several white guys in the film. The movie itself was good and the music was fun, although I don't generally listen to Gospel style music, it's fun every once in a while and it was fun to see a movie with a decent story and a family friendly environment. So give it a try.</p>

<p>This morning I felt quite sick with the flu so I didn't go to church, more for being worried that I would infect the congregation then for my own purposes, so I spent most of today playing <strong>Warcraft III</strong> and then editing some <strong>ACTD</strong> transcripts for the <em>Artemis</em>.</p>

<p>That's about all for tonight I guess, <em>TTFN</em></p>

        <p>It's been a very long day, yet i'm still up, I couldn't sleep so I wrote another chapter of my fanfic, up to 13 chapters now (14 if you include the prologue) and is very close to being done, course I really thought I'd be done at chapter 10, but I just kinda kept going, I think there will only be one more chapter but I'm not sure, I may extend it.Today was an overall nice day, I got a fun task to do next week, I got some work done, I watched the season premier of Enterprise and best of all, I got permission from my mom to visit D next weekend. Well not much to say about today, I'll write a review of <em>The Xindi</em> soon and get it up at the SubspaceLink, <em>TTFN</em>!</p>

<p>Anyway, I actually saw that several days ago but i figured I should put a reference to it in my blog, so feel free to click the icons above to see a little piece of Internet History.</p>

<p>I was up working on upgrading and reinstalling a server all night last night, but finally got it just about ready to send to San Jose, as such I got to work very late today and when I got there I was feeling &#8220;<em>blah</em>&#8221;, I just didn't want to do anything. What's more, Harold was wanting to discuss how he thinks all churches are corrupt because they pay their pastors, no matter how much I tried to point out to him that being a pastor is a full time job and should be supported so that he could devote his time to serving the community instead of working a 2nd job just to survive, he disagrees, he seems to think that the tithes given at church should go towards supporting the community and somehow the financial needs of the church (like mortgage payments on the building and upkeeping and staff members and many other things that a church needs to function). Anyway I spent my time working on a few menial tasks like the ARIN IP requisition forms for our ISP we are starting up, and working on our classified advertisements for our employment ads).</p>

<p>Tonight I went over to the house of a member of my church's youth group to work with him on the christmas play I wrote, we are weeding out the flaws in the script and getting ready to get started, was over there for a while and got a lot prepared, I think the Christmas Play is going to be awesome, when I've got more I might post the script online for anyone who cares to read it. Anyway, that's all for now, talk to ya'll later.</p>

        <p>Ah another day, another bout of pain&#8230;. I am really wondering why my head is hurting so much lately, but it is really bugging me how much my head hurts at times. I cannot remember ever not having a headache in my life, but lately they have been really bad, I guess it must be stress. Have i mentioned lately how much I absolutely hate my job? Oh&#8230; I did, oh well, I'm saying it again anyway, I hate working for Metrotime!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>My boss was complaining about absolutely everything today, even though I managed to accomplish not 1 but 3 major tasks today, which considering I'm the entire IT department of that company is a major accomplishment indeed, yet for whatever reason he was complaining about everything today, things weren't working exactly the way he wanted so I'd fix that, then I'd go back to working on a major task, then he'd be complaining about something else and I'd fix that, and go back to the major task, so between fielding his whining and getting 3 major tasks done, I worked a very hard day for barely any gratitude at all! Oh I hope I can find a better job soon, or I think the stress of this hard work with little pay and no appreciation will end up putting me in a psych ward.</p>

<p>At least I was able to talk to D for a long time tonight, it's rare that I'm able to get ahold of her and I do enjoy talking to her, so the few times I can talk to her on the phone are always a good way to lift my spirits for the day. Unlike me, she had a good day, however when I called her she said she was waiting for a call from her old boyfriend, so I'm wondering if that means she is getting back together with him, I hope not because I was really hoping to be her new boyfriend. Course I probably shouldn't write this cause D is just about the only person I know who ever reads this, and I hope that if she does she won't get mad at me or anything. And if she does&#8230; D, I'm so looking forward to visiting you.</p>

        <p>Today was a very long day, I had to get up earlier then normal today to get to the office so that we could ride to Dallas and get there by 11:30 for a meeting with a long time client of Metrotime. Shortly into the beginning of the meeting my cell phone rang, this is actually the first time this has ever happened to me during a business meeting. I was going to ignore it but the client said he needed an excuse to step out of the room for a minute anyway, so I took the call. It was &#8220;Mr. E,&#8221; the head of the audio/visual team at my church.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>He called to ask me if I could be at the church at 6 p.m. tonight to help run powerpoint for the &#8220;Team Build&#8221; meeting that was going to take place this evening and if I could run the sound board on Saturday for a seminar that was going to take place that he would be unable to run sound for, I said sure on both counts. Momentarily after hanging up the client returned and described the tasks that he needed me to do for him, we left the office and Dallas and took 3 other stops on the way back to Fort Worth, 2 quick office stops and a lunch stop at Taco Bell (<em>yumm, cheesy gordita crunch</em>), before heading back to the office, then I did some work on some cd duplications and some editing of the Metrotime website. I left just after 5 so that I could stop at the bank and get some cash on the way to the church, I arrived at 5:52 exactly and worked the event till 8:30 when I came home.</p>

<p>So that's pretty much my life today, oh btw, I'm having a blast with my new laptop, it doesn't run anywhere near as hot as most of the laptops I've used in the past, and the battery life is amazing, I was using it at the church for over an hour with the wireless card enabled not plugged in and when I was about to shut it down the battery gage read 5 hours 3 minutes of battery remaining, amazing. Well, g'night for tonight, <em>TTFN</em>!</p>

        <p>And this is my first blog entry typed on my brand new laptop computer, I've been waiting for my own laptop for a long time and now I finally have one. As society gets faster and faster, mobility is a necessity in the computing world. Now that I have a laptop I can blog on the go, I may have to start frequenting coffee shops 🙂 or perhaps not. Anyway today was a highly productive day, I fixed most of a <a href="http://www.freeside.biz/freeside/">freeside</a> installation, made some modifications to allow for more dynamic formatting of the invoices, repaired a computer, repaired an SQL installation, and after I came home I started personalizing the new laptop that arrived FedEx while I was at work and installing the programs I'll need to do my job effectively.</p>

<p>Not that much more going on and I have to get up early in the morning because I will have to take a trip out to Dallas to visit a client so I'll end this log entry for now, talk to ya'll again soon.</p>

        <p>oh look 5 a.m., I had washed my sheets last night and then I forgot to put them in the dryer so at 3:30 when I realized I wanted to go to bed, I didn't have any sheets, so I put them in the dryer and then chatted online for a while and then wrote another chapter of my FanFic (<em>Miles Apart</em>), I had meant this chapter 12 to be my last, but I was writing and it ended up longer then any of my previous chapters and I wasn't ready to end yet, so I ended it at a logical place and will write a chapter 13, not sure if that will wrap it up either, but it might.</p>

<p>Anyway it's been a week since I last posted, I've had a crummy work week, a really crummy one.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Monday I went in and my boss was being a complete <abbr title="ass">....</abbr> about the web-hosting server, first we're condensing 2 servers to 1 even though he said he'd get the 2nd and did not, then he comes up with this &#8220;I want you to turn off the spam and virus filters because I don't like it that one of my messages got caught by mistake and you had access to get it back&#8221; and I was like &#8220;would you rather the message gotten lost forever?&#8221; but is all up on some privacy kick so I removed the virus and spam filters, but because of the way they were set up it was all or nothing, I couldn't just remove it from his account, I had to remove it from ALL accounts so now I get a ridiculous amount of spam. Then he's also had this box he's wanted me to work on that I always had a hunch was going to be a lot of work for no pay and he had wanted me to just get paid from what he charges the client, I ended up working on that box ALL WEEK LONG and still to no avail, the box is still not ready, it's driving me nuts!</p>

<p>It has been the work week from hell, and yet my online friends are telling me I need to work more hours, I can't stand working too many hours with him, he questions every single hour I put on my timecard, he gives me ridiculous tasks, and he thinks he's doing me a favor in all of it! I can't stand it anymore.</p>

<p>What's worse is this is my only avenue to vent this stuff and I have this fear that he is going to see this blog one day and get pissed at me and I'll have burned a bridge without wanting to.</p>

<p>Anyway it's been the whole week from hell except for Wednesday and Friday, Wednesday work was murder but when I got home me and Dad went online (after watching an <em>Enterprise</em> double feature which I enjoyed cause it was like the first time I've sat down and watched an episode of trek with him where he seemed to be enjoying it) and specced out my new laptop computer at dell.com and ordered it so it should be coming next week, of course after doing all that I picked up the newspaper on Thursday and there was an announcement &#8220;Effective today, Dell is dropping their prices on most of their merchandise!&#8221; which included their line of laptops but that's ok, I'm still getting a nice laptop at a decent price and I'll be able to work more efficiently, instead of waiting till the middle of the night to use my dad's computer like I am now.</p>

<p>Today (Friday, not the 5 hours between midnight and now) was fun, I went to Frys to purchase some parts to upgrade a server for my friend JMac, and then my entire family went to <strong><a href="http://www.medievaltimes.com/">Medieval Times</a></strong> to celebrate my little brother's 18th birthday which was today.</p>

<p>Medieval Times was a blast, David was &#8220;knighted&#8221; and got a souvenir photo, the meal was great (and where else can you pay high prices and then eat messily with your hands on dented metal plates), and the entertainment was an absolute blast. We were in the front row of the Yellow section and had an excellent view of the stadium. I highly recommend you go to one of these places if you ever get the opportunity, it is an absolute blast</p>

<p>So I may write more later but now I'm exhausted as it is now 5:30 a.m. and I've been up all night, so good night all.</p>

        <p><em>::in best news voice::</em> And this is Nick Moline with the weekend report <em>::end news voice::</em></p>

<p>Yesterday was interesting, mom threw a Jewelry party at the house so I sought the first excuse I could to get out of there, and that excuse ended up being helping my dad (who was also trying to escape the women buying jewelry) pick out my little brother's birthday present (his birthday is this coming Friday), on the off chance that he reads this or that one of his friends reads this and passes it on to him, I won't say anything further about gift shopping.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>So I took a separate car then my dad so we took a slightly longer then normal time shopping for the gift then Dad went back to the party and I snuck off to the movies. On the risk of embarrassing myself I will tell you what movie I went and saw, <em>Freaky Friday</em>. Newsflash all, it's good, no really it is!</p>

<p>Yes it's a 3rd version of the same movie by the same movie studio (for those of you who don't know, there was a made for TV movie version of <em>Freaky Friday</em> back in '95 in addition to the 70's original with Jodie Foster). I have to say this latest version with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohen is very good, perhaps better then the original.</p>

<p>Lindsay is very convincing as both the Teen and the adult in the teen body, Jamie is also convincing in both her roles and plays a hilarious teen trapped in a woman's body, however although it is a convincing teen, it's not very convincing that it is Anna (Lindsay's character at the beginning of the movie) trapped in Tess's body rather then some other teen, Lindsay is a bit more mellow in general then the &#8220;child version&#8221; of Curtis, but it was still hilarious, the only problem with the movie is I think they went over the top in Anna's love interest in the movie falling for Anna stuck in Tess's body, yes I know the point was to show that he liked Anna for her mind not her body, but yuck, it went a bit too far when he was singing &#8220;<em>Hit Me Baby One More Time</em>&#8221; outside Tess' window, talk about freaky.</p>

<p>Anyway after the party one of mom's friends was still hanging around the house for several hours, but one is manageable, 10 is not.</p>

<p>On to today&#8230;</p>

<p>I got up early to go to church, Mr. E the head of the audio visual team had told me earlier that I would be put in a rotational schedule and not be needed every week but he hadn't yet told me what that schedule was so I decided to come anyway just in case it was my week, turns out it was not, next week is. So I still went to both services anyway, was actually kinda cool, in the first service I was asked to help collect the offering for the first time in the 4 and a half years I've gone to this church. In the 2nd service I sat with my family for the first time in a long time, well most of my family, David sat with the youth group, but it was nice to sit with my parents for once.</p>

<p>After church and a brief lunch the four of us went to see a play at Theater Arlington, that was fun, it is the second time I've been there, the first time was for a presentation of <em>It's a Wonderful Life</em> back in December, today's presentation was called <em>Communicating Doors</em> and dealt with time travel, it was quite good, I won't discuss the plot here cause it would take too long, but I found it quite interesting and entertaining, a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Overall it was a nice weekend, but in the morning it is back to the grindstone, how fun! <em>TTFN</em>!</p>

        <p>Well today I had to send back the company laptop to North Carolina, over $70 it cost to ship that thing, yowza!</p>

<p>So now I have no computer of my own to use anymore, someone online suggested I check out rent-a-center so I've submitted an info request to them, my Dad said I should check out Dell's financing options on getting a laptop so I've done some looking there as well, so hopefully I will have a laptop again soon so that I can continue to work.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Worked on trying to get the billing system working on the new server today, had a few snags but I should be able to iron them out quickly enough, just not right now, right now I'm going home, I'm tired and I haven't eaten anything ALL DAY!</p>

<p>Other then that, not much is happening, except for the fact that I just realized that the .doc file of my new book I'm writing (<em>Another Time</em>) was on that laptop that I just shipped away DOH!!!!! I forgot to take the file off, how stupid of me! Aww man! Oh well, I guess I'll have to start over at the beginning, darn and I was 2 chapters into the book already too.</p>

<p>Well I'll update again tomorrow I think, <em>TTFN</em>!</p>

        <p>On the highly unlikely chance that someone is actually reading my blog&#8230;. you may have wondered if I dropped off the face of the earth or something, no I did not, in actuality I moved back in with my family in TX, got settled in, and then&#8230; took a vacation! Actually my 21st birthday was this past Sunday and my mom and I have been planning to visit Vegas for my 21st birthday for the past 2 years.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I should have known I wouldn't have any luck whatsoever when we got to the first hotel room on Friday night (we stayed at a different location each night as we were bargain bouncing). The first night we stayed at the most shabby of the 3 locations, Motel 6. After a ridiculous amount of difficulty finding our room, we found out that our key did not work, so we found our way back to the lobby where they told us that they sent us to the wrong room, so another room hunt later and we had found the new room, well I was carrying my bags upstairs and I was wearing new dress shoes (a requirement for the type of tickets we fly on) that I wasn't used to wearing yet, well the walkway on the 2nd floor was uneven and I quickly found myself tripping over my feet and then sprawled out in pain with a badly twisted ankle. I should have known then that I wouldn't have any luck all weekend 😛</p>

<p>Despite the fact that I was still in great pain, Saturday was very nice. We started out by having brunch at the <em>MGM Grand</em>, and while the brunch was overpriced and bland, it wasn't bad, afterwards we took a look at the Lion habitat, mom was fascinated by the &#8220;big kitties&#8221; as she called them, well I wasn't 21 yet so it would have been a state felony for me to loiter around while mom played the slots so instead we went and found the hotel that we would be staying in that night, the French Quarter Suites so that we could check in and unload our bags rather then carry them around the rest of the day. Unfortunately there had been some mix up in the reservation and the room did not have 2 beds like it was supposed to, so I had the joy of sleeping on a rollaway bed that night, but I am jumping ahead.</p>

<p>After checking in we found our way to the Trek fan's paradise, <a href="http://www.startrekexp.com/">Star Trek: The Experience</a> in the Las Vegas Hilton. Those of you who know <a href="http://www.subspacelink.com/">my website</a> may know that I have been there before, so rather then describe the ride here, I'll just <a href="http://www.subspacelink.com/index.pl?iid=14097">point you to my previous explanation</a> of the ride and then explain what has changed. What has changed? Well first of all the lines are much shorter now so you can ride it more times in less time for one thing, but the bigger change is that they have an addon now where for $14.99 extra you can go onto the Bridge of the Enterprise D alone (with full lightning as opposed to the red alert lighting you see during the ride), sit in the captain's chair, and have your picture taken, then get that picture as a souvenir. As soon as I can arrange to have that picture scanned I'll put it up here. But while I hate the way I look in this photograph, it was worth it just to sit in the captain's chair and walk around the bridge for a few minutes. I had an awesome time.</p>

<p>I stayed at the experience for a few hours, browsed the shops and rode the ride a couple times before me and Mom headed to buy a few items at the store and then go to dinner. I needed to pick up a network cable so that I could plug in the laptop at the hotel and we picked up some sodas and some other items to consume later that evening and then we went to the best meal in vegas, <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/">In-n-out burger</a>, no really I'm serious. I used to love those places back when I lived in Southern California, they have absolutely the best french fries in the universe, and great burgers too. Kinda odd that we would spend $15 each to have brunch and not like it, and then spend less then $5 each for dinner and love it, but we did.</p>

<p>Back at the hotel we played some cards and watched some television, mom was tired so she went to bed but she told me to wake her up at midnight so we can celebrate my birthday. I attempted to hook up the laptop but found out that the data tap in my room was broken, so I couldn't get on the internet and&#8230; update this blog!</p>

<p>I let mom sleep till about 1 a.m. and then woke her up as she requested, she brought out the items she had selected for me to &#8220;try,&#8221; a bottle of champagne, a small bottle of merlot, and a small bottle of white-zymphendel, I didn't care for any of the 3 of them unfortunately, how can anyone drink this stuff? We finished our ongoing game of rummy and then went to bed, where I slept on the rollaway bed I mentioned previously (now not only was my ankle hurting but I had a stiff back too, oh well)</p>

<p>Sunday morning we decided to try a brunch at the casino that was across the street from the French Quarter Suites, <a href="http://www.orleanscasino.com/">The Orleans Hotel and Casino</a>. This brunch was a few dollars cheaper then the one at the MGM on Saturday but despite this, it was a much much better brunch. This place has everything, if you are vacationing in Vegas and want a good meal, go there, trust me! I had mongolian bar-b-q, seafood, pasta (I am not a breakfast person so I was going for the lunch items on the menu, it was 11:30 after all) and all sorts of other delicious treats, both mom and me topped it off with a do it yourself strawberry shortcake from their desert bar, fabulous!</p>

<p>After breakfast mom and me decided to see a movie in the movie theater inside that casino, well this is the second time that day that that particular casino impressed me, the movie theater was full sized, they had like 18 screens. We saw Tomb Raider 2 and both enjoyed it, I found it better then the first Tomb Raider movie as it displayed her as closer to her game character, solving puzzles and the like. Go see it if you like action flicks.</p>

<p>Anyway afterwords mom and I went to the Luxor and took a look around, Mom had always wanted to check out the inside of that place, it was pretty cool, I love researching ancient history so seeing a place done up in an ancient egypt theme was very cool, though personally I preferred the next place we visited, we took the moving sidewalks across the street to the <em><a href="https://excalibur.mgmresorts.com/en.html">Excalibur</a></em>, I love the medieval period, so the castle theme was more fun to me then the egyptian theme, we caught 2 shows at a small stage, a juggling act and a magic act that was quite fun, and then I got a picture of me in the stocks (although I have pictures of most of these locations I'll just give a link to them at the end of this blog entry) which I know some of you, especially D, would love to see me clapped in irons so here it is.</p>

<p>Sorry that the lighting isn't better but my camera was really acting up this weekend. Anyway making our way back through the sky-walks and through the Luxor and out to the rental car, we were then tired enough to go check into the 3rd and final hotel for the night, the <em><a href="http://www.stardustlv.com/">Stardust</a></em>. We tried to check in via the automated check in but it wouldn't work so we waited in line for the check in counter where we were given our room keys and instructions to go up to the 20th floor (man was I ever glad the elevators were working whew). When we got to our room we found that housekeeping had neglected to clean that room so I called the front desk and let them know, then mom and I went down to use our $5 off vouchers for a meal at their buffet. The buffet wasn't bad but I didn't have anything actually off of the buffet anyway, we both had steak and lobster tail and then some sides from the buffet, it was pretty good.</p>

<p>All throughout this day I had played a few slot machines at each casino we stopped at, the only place I had any luck was the Orleans where I left that place with more then I got there with, every place else sucked me dry but no place drained me as fast as the Stardust did, both me and mom lost everything we had brough to gamble with but both of us had been responsible enough to only bring a set amount to gamble with and we were not going to go spend more then that.</p>

<p>914So Monday after packing up early, we had nothing left to spend on the slots so we went to have one last&#8230; BURGER AT IN-N-OUT BURGER!!!! yumyumyum!!!!!! before returning the rental car, heading to the airport, and waiting 4 and a half hours for our return flight home. So that's how I spent my 21st birthday, to see the rest of the pics I took in my camera, click the image on the left.</p>

<p>Today was tiring, I spent the day moving things from an old server to a new server it was time consuming and it gave me a headache, especially when there was a routing issue in the new server and I couldn't get it online correctly, but the subspacelink is on a new box now, as well as the sites of all of metrotime's customers. That's all for now, I'll post again soon.</p>

        <p>What I meant to mention in my earlier post but neglected to say because I started ranting is that the latest thing to bug me in my life is the fact that I had been very much looking forward to my brother visiting me today from TX, but his flight was cancelled and he couldn't come. The flights aren't looking very good for tomorrow either so I am not sure if he will make it tomorrow either.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Well I thought that I should write another chapter of Miles Apart because if my brother catches me writing a Lizzie McGuire fanfic he would tease me relentlessly, so I figured I'd get another chapter in before he came to hold me over till I had some privacy again. Unfortunately I have come across something that I haven't had before while writing this story, a slight case of writers block. It's not that I don't have ideas on how to continue the story, in actuality I have 4 completely different ideas on how to continue from this point, and I'm having the hardest time deciding between them&#8230;. perhaps I could do a multiple reality storyline and try them all? Or not, that's too confusing, I think I'll just have to spend a little while to decide on one of them, perhaps I'll write it later tonight.</p>

        <p>Well my depression that has been setting in deeper and deeper for months now hit a new low this morning at about 3 a.m. The final confirmation that we are closing down the office came from the boss. I'm jobless and am going to have to move back in with my family. Furthermore I'm going to end up going into debt to my old boss to be able to afford to do this. I really don't want to work for him on a long term basis again but I'm feeling as if I may have no choice.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I sent my resume to one company yesterday, got the response back that they have no openings available but will keep me in mind when openings do come up. I'm going to send it off to another company today, anything to avoid working for Metrotime again. I can handle working for Metrotime for a few weeks or even a month or two, but I don't want to get myself locked into it, I was not treated properly there and the sad thing is my boss didn't even realize how poorly he was treating me. He seemed to think he was doing me a favor and that he was incredibly kind to me. He does have a kind atitude most of the time, but it's not all about attitude, it's about respect. I didn't get it there. I was asked to do ridiculous tasks and I was never even offered an actual position, I was a consultant the entire 2 years I worked for him, which of course meant double taxes (self employment tax). He would continually say &#8220;I'm going to put you on regular <em>insert time here</em>&#8220;, but each time he would say that, the time would come, and the time would go, and then weeks later he would say again, &#8220;I'm going to put you on regular <em>insert another time here</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>It's not only that, I gave him my business outright and asked for only 2 things in return. I asked that #1) he pay me for my time when I <strong>had</strong> to work on the server, and #2) That he honor the agreements I had made with several of my customers. Well there were several instances where he would <strong>order</strong> me to continually work on the server until the task was completed and then when it came time to pay, would not pay me for anything after say 6 p.m. when I worked all night and into the next day to fix the problem that he would order me to do. I did not appreciate that one bit, but I kept my mouth shut. As for my customers, he would continually say things like &#8220;How come this person is only paying this much?&#8221; and I would answer &#8220;Cause that's what we agreed upon&#8221; and he would say &#8220;Well he should be paying this much, I'm going to send him a letter.&#8221; That really pissed me off, I asked for only 2 things when I gave him my business with my customers and he wouldn't keep to either one of them.</p>

<p>He didn't even realize he was doing it, it drove me crazy, how could he not see what he was doing to me, how could he not see how much he hurt me all the time? And now he seems like my only hope for being able to afford to move my stuff back home. Talk about your tripple whamy.</p>

<ol>
<li>The one thing I have always wanted was to be independent, to be able to provide for myself, now after living that dream for only 6 months I have to move back home with my parents.</li>
<li>The only way I can afford to do so is to get my old boss that I hated working for to front me the money necessary to rent the uHaul and pay for gas, lodging, and food for the trip home, thus putting me in his debt and requiring me to work for him again.</li>
<li>On top of all this, I cannot help but feel the shame as if I am a complete failure for this project not working</li>
</ol>

<p>Yeah I know the last one really doesn't make sense, especially for those of you that know my situation. The problems of <em>Western Carolina Wireless</em> are not at all my fault, and I worked incredibly hard to circumvent those problems to no avail. But I'm a perfectionist, when a project I'm working on fails, I cannot help but feel shame at failure. I hate defeat. I loathe it, but here it is, staring right at me. What am I to do?</p>

<p>One thing is certain, I have GOT to find a job with medical benefits so that I can see a doctor about what I believe to be clinical depression.</p>

        <p>Well the continuing saga of if <em>Western Carolina Wireless</em> is going to continue operating goes on and on. Depression seemed to be at one of its highest points ever at the office today. In fact both of my coworkers left considerably early, and before 3 p.m. I was the only one at the office, and I stayed there till about 6 all alone.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Trying to get a response out of my boss is sometimes like trying to turn water into wine, yeah you know someone's done it before but you sure as heck don't know how to do it yourself.</p>

<p>Basically we found out today that the next round of paychecks will be our absolute last. The pay period ends this Friday and then the paychecks arrive next Friday. Basically next week we will be working minimal to keep things operating, but my coworkers are not planning to install any new service.</p>

<p>As for me personally&#8230;. Well if there are any businesses out there that need my skills, drop me a line.</p>

<p>In other news, I've been rather lonely lately and have been waiting impatiently for the promised visit from my little brother. He promised months ago that he would come to visit me this week, but day after day I ask him &#8220;what day you coming&#8221; and the answer is &#8220;this week&#8221; Of course he has only 2 more days where he can possibly answer &#8220;This week&#8221; before he lies.</p>

<p>Ahh depression, it is so much fun, perhaps I should write another chapter of my fanfic, that always cheers me up, oh wait I already did that today, perhaps I'll just watch Who's Line is it Anyway (which just came on TV), talk to you all later.</p>

        <p>This <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090503155719/http://www.wbloggar.com/">w.bloggar</a> thingy is pretty cool, nice to be able to work on the blog without signing into the site first and stuff, not to mention it makes it like writing an e-mail, all y'all that do this kind of stuff should give it a try.</p>

<p>Ug today was absolutely boring, I normally watch a few Disney Channel shows on Saturdays but they are doing a Kim Possible Marathon and I don't really care about Kim Possible, someone kill me now!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>It's not that I dislike Kim Possible, I watch it when there is nothing else on, but as such I've seen just about every episode, and since it doesn't really excite me or anything, 8 hours of reruns of a show I don't care one way or the other about is incredibly dull!</p>

<p>I'd spend my time writing another chapter of my story but I already posted one today (as you can see here) and only 8 people have seen that new chapter so far so another one today might be pushing it, not even sure if anyone likes my previous chapter.</p>

<p>Anyway, day boring but it contrasts well with yesterday being ridiculously busy for me. Yesterday I had to rush to the office because my coworker was having problems with his laptop, then I was working on some plans for altering the structure of the company I work for to encourage the RIAA to not stop our funding and close us down. Then at 5 minutes to quitting time, a customer calls with no service. We rush over there, and end up spending a couple hours working in the hot sun to get the customer working again, I quickly ate dinner and then I rushed home and had a matter of minutes to spare before my ACTD mission.</p>

<p>The ACTD mission however was the highlight of my day yesterday, it was hilarious. For those of you who don't know, ACTD stands for A Call To Duty and is an IRC based Star Trek Role Playing Game (RPG). I played for a few years a long time ago, about 6 months before I left the game however I &#8220;killed&#8221; off my first character by having him fall into a spiraling vortex, nobody knows what ACTD did to kill off my 2nd character.</p>

<p>Anyway when I rejoined recently I decided to instead of creating a new character, revive my first one, who it turns out has spent the last 4 years marooned on a moon with a tropical environment and absolutely no humanoid life.</p>

<p>So my character who was &#8220;Rescued&#8221; about a month ago is still suffering from cast away syndrome and is slightly insane, and last night I really got to push my insanity to the max. See last night took place after an engineered 2 day time lapse, as I was in my quarters at the end of the last mission and there was a guard posted at my door, I assumed that I have spent the last 2 days in lock-down. Of course since I had just spent the last 4 years with an entire moon to myself, being locked in a small room was upsetting to me, so I started by pounding on the walls shouting &#8220;LET ME OUT LET ME OUT&#8221; and &#8220;I FREE, I CLAUSTER&#8230;. CLASTER&#8230; CLOSTER.. small space scared&#8221;, then after doing that for a few minutes my character decided that he was too heavy in 1G gravity, as the moon he had lived on had about 1/4 Earth gravity, so he started tampering with the Artificial Gravity Generators in his quarters, he made a simple mistake and instead of decreasing the gravity, shut it off, which to a bored insane person was a lot of fun, so instead of fixing it, I flew around the room singing &#8220;He flies through the air with the greatest of ease, the daring young man on the flying trapeze.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well of course main engineering noticed that the gravity in my quarters had gone nill incredibly quickly and the Chief Engineer came to investigate. As he entered my quarters (wearing magnetic boots) he just happened to come in at the same time I flew at top speed directly towards the door area, I rammed into him at maximum speed, he angrily threw me out of the gravity free room into the hallway (that still had gravity) causing me to fall to the ground. After fixing the gravity in the room, the CEO asked me to join him in the Mess Hall for a drink, at which point I explained my weird grammar structure as being a result of using my telepathic powers (I was full Betazoid) to talk to the animals of the moon I lived on for 4 years, also explaining why my telepathic powers had grown incredibly strong over that period of time.</p>

<p>So anyway I had a great time exercising my character's insanity, it is the most fun I have every week. I guess it lets me get my inner insanity out, speaking of insanity. My friend Mike sent me a url for a Personality Disorder test to take this week, here are my results:</p>

        <p>Earlier this week I decided to start entering more of the internet culture, I've been a webmaster since 1995 and I've kinda got caught in my old ways when I started doing perl programming and such. I noticed that more recent aspects internet culture have gone ignored by me. Last Friday I started publishing my first Fanfic. Unlike what a lot of you would think, I did NOT base it on the <em>Star Trek</em> universe (perhaps I will write my next fanfic in this universe), but instead I picked a show with lighter content to get started, I picked to base the fanfic on the show <em>Lizzie McGuire</em> (Disney Channel and ABC).</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Today I decided that I should perhaps start another popular element of Internet Culture, and that is, the weblog or <strong>blog</strong> as it is commonly known. Now I could have written my own system to do it, and perhaps one day I will, but for now I decided it would be easiest to go with the commonly used Movable Type program, seems simple enough, I intend to play with the templating features of it soon, but for starters this will be a tad plain. I do kinda like the Categories thing, this way I can do things like Personal Logs, Duty Logs, my ACTD Logs, and Fanfic updates and easily identify the difference between them.</p>

<p>So here I am, writing my very first blog entry and it seem somewhat natural actually, why didn't I do this a long time ago? I dunno, but I intend to keep this regularly updated.</p>
