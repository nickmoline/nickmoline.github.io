My [latest post](https://onward.justia.com/2016/11/01/structured-data/) on Justia's Legal Marketing & Technology Blog just went live and it is all about [Structured Data and the Semantic Web](https://onward.justia.com/2016/11/01/structured-data/).  I talk and write quite a bit about the Semantic Web and decided it was high time I write a primer on just what it is and why it is important.  Be sure to [check it out](https://onward.justia.com/2016/11/01/structured-data/) over on Justia's blog.
