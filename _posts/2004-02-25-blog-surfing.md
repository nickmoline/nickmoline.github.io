One of the side effects of having a blog and having friends who have blogs, not to mention the whole being jobless thing, is that as I surf around the blogs of friends I find that they are up to far more interesting things then I am&#8230; Take <a target="_blank" title="andymatter.com" href="http://www.andymatter.com/" class="broken_link">Andy</a> for example, I was reading the last few entries of his blog today and apparently he is working on a <a target="_blank" title="Minesweeper for a Thesis" href="http://www.andymatter.com/blog/archives/000247.php" class="broken_link">Minesweeper Thesis</a>, how fun is that? The idea is to come up with the mathematical probabilities of winning at Minesweeper, he&#8217;s got a chart and everything.

I need an interesting project to work on&#8230;. Oh well&#8230;
