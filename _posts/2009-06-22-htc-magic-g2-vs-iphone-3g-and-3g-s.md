Check out [my review of the HTC Magic (T-Mobile G2) and the comparisons against the iPhone 3G and 3GS on LLRX](https://www.llrx.com/2009/06/review-of-htc-magic-g2-vs-iphone-3g-and-3g-s/). This is my third article published on LLRX. I am writing another article for the site, with my review of Google Wave, which should be out in the next week or two. (By posting this here, I am forcing myself to get it done, hopefully.)
