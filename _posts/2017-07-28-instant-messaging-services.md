For a small business, it can be hard to decide which tech products and services you want to use to solve the various needs of your employees and clients.  To that end I've started a [new series](https://onward.justia.com/tag/the-collaborative-law-firm/) of posts on Justia's Legal Marketing & Technology Blog to help business owners make an informed decision for their business.

While the series is aimed at Law Firms, it contains helpful comparisons that are helpful to any small business.  The [first post](https://onward.justia.com/2017/07/28/collaborative-law-firm-instant-messaging/) in this series is about Instant Messaging services.  I review several mainstream services (Skype, Google Hangouts, Facebook Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger, and Yahoo Messenger), as well as business hosted services (Skype for Business, GSuite Hangouts), and even describe how you can host your own instant messaging service within your company using XMPP.
