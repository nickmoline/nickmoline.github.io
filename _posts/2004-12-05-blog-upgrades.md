Well I&#8217;ve upgraded my blog again. It was a bigger ordeal then usual because I had to actually do a fresh install and then reimport the data, but it was explained well and it took barely any time to accomplish it.

<!--more-->

Lots of nifty new features. I don&#8217;t think I care for the built in gallery, especially as I have worked so long and hard on my own gallery and it would be quite painful to start over. So I will soon be editing the gallery link shown above to point to my gallery instead of using the one now built into BLOG:CMS. I&#8217;m also not sure why I would need/want a WIKI system on my site. I do however kinda like the new forum feature, not to mention the fact that all blog entries are automatically added to the forum for all to see and now comment on. Theoretically this entry has already been added to the gallery so you should be able to start posting away your comments about it, assuming you care at all that is.
