[FedEx Express | Tracking | Results Detail](http://www.fedex.com/cgi-bin/tracking "FedEx Express | Tracking | Results Detail")

Just been tracking a package I&#8217;ve been sending that&#8217;s all <!--Element not supported - Type: 8 Name: #comment--> Should arrive at its destination on Wednesday, hope so.

Well I&#8217;ve been home sick with the flu all day and I probably should be getting some more rest so I&#8217;m going to go to bed now.
