The Gastric sleeve surgery I mentioned in [my earlier post]({% post_url 2012-06-01-weight-loss-update-and-transparency %} "Weight Loss Update and transparency") has been scheduled for July 26, 2012 at 10:00am at <a href="https://www.elcaminohospital.org/Locations" target="_blank">El Camino Hospital</a>. Â This is the same hospital I was in last fall when I had Cellulitis in my left leg.
