and I&#8217;m really feeling the pressure of this liquid only diet.  It&#8217;s hard, it&#8217;s extremely hard.  The strange thing is, it&#8217;s not the lack of food that makes it hardest.  What makes it really hard is that I&#8217;m just sick of the protein shakes.

Fortunately a good friend and coworker has brought me some home made chicken stock that while still just being liquid broth, is a great respit for me once a day from the monotony of protein shakes.  Thank you.

Next thursday I will go under, and when I come out I&#8217;ll have a tiny stomach that should make dieting easier, hopefully.
