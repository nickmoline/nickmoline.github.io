As most of you have probably figured out by now, i suck at graphical interfaces, and as part of that, I can&#8217;t create a good looking template, I compensate for my lack of creative juices by making my sites and blog do as much as humanly possible. Unlike my friends like <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.jmaclabs.com/blog/">JMac</span> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.andymatter.com/" class="broken_link">Andy</a> who actually have decent looking sites, mine is ugly but does as much as possible. The latest plug-in I installed? A Plug-in to generate animated maps automatically, like this one, which shows a pan from my  
home to mid Tennessee (A Trip I&#8217;ve <a target="_blank" href="http://cap.portalkeeper.info/archives/000022.html" class="broken_link">done before</a> that I&#8217;m just dying to duplicate as soon as possible). Plug-ins are  
fun, I should look into writing a few of my own, rather then just modifying the ones made by others to tweak them the way I want them.
