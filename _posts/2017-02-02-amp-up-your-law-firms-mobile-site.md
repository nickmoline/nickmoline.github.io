I'm really excited about my [latest post](https://onward.justia.com/2017/02/02/amp-your-law-firm-mobile-site/) on Justia's blog because it is about a new Justia service that I was instrumental in bringing about.  Justia has developed a technique to create [AMP](https://amp.dev) versions of all of our clients' websites and blogs.  I've been pretty excited about the Accelerated Mobile Pages project for a while now as it allows for websites that load instantly the moment you tap the link in search results.  Check out more about AMP and about Justia's new offering in my blog post on the Justia blog.
