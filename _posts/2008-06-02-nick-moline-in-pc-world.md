Ok, I admit it, I haven&#8217;t been a subscriber to [PC World](http://www.pcworld.com/) magazine in a few years, even before I became a member of the Mac camp, but I&#8217;m really excited to say that a couple interview questions with me are now [published in PC World!](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/146374/google_cements_commitment_to_developers_with_io_event.html) in an article about Google I/O. It was very cool to be able to do a [Google News Search for Nick Moline](http://news.google.com/news?q=nick+moline) and actually find an article that I&#8217;m a part of, even if it is just a couple sentences.
