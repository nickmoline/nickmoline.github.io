I&#8217;m not sure why I&#8217;ve never done this before, but I&#8217;m writing this blog entry from the air, literally. Barbara and I are on our way to Texas to attend my brother&#8217;s wedding. David is getting married on Saturday in Houston. We are on our way to my parent&#8217;s house in Arlington at the moment and will drive down with my parents on Friday.

We should be landing in about a half hour or so, after flying for a total of about 3 hours and 15 minutes, and I don&#8217;t have too much to say at the moment. I&#8217;m sure to post pictures of the wedding up soon.

_Note, while I wrote this on the plane, obviously I had no way to post this from the air so I&#8217;ll hit the Publish button when I get to my parent&#8217;s house._
