  It&#8217;s been a very long day, yet i&#8217;m still up, I couldn&#8217;t sleep so I wrote another chapter of my fanfic, up to 13 chapters now (14 if you include the prologue) and is very close to being done, course I really thought I&#8217;d be done at chapter 10, but I just kinda kept going, I think there will only be one more chapter but I&#8217;m not sure, I may extend it.Today was an overall nice day, I got a fun task to do next week, I got some work done, I watched the season pramier of Enterprise and best of all, I got permission from my mom to visit D next weekend. Well not much to say about today, I&#8217;ll write a review of <em>The Xindi</em> soon and get it up at the SubspaceLink, ttfn!
