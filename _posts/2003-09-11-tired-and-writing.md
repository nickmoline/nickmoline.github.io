It's been a very long day, yet i'm still up, I couldn't sleep so I wrote another chapter of my fanfic, up to 13 chapters now (14 if you include the prologue) and is very close to being done, course I really thought I'd be done at chapter 10, but I just kinda kept going, I think there will only be one more chapter but I'm not sure, I may extend it.Today was an overall nice day, I got a fun task to do next week, I got some work done, I watched the season premier of Enterprise and best of all, I got permission from my mom to visit D next weekend. Well not much to say about today, I'll write a review of _The Xindi_ soon and get it up at the SubspaceLink, _TTFN_!
