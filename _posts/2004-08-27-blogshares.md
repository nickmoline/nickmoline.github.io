no, I&#8217;m not going to sing a christmas song&#8230;

Earlier today JMac asked me if I played with the Blogshares fantasy stock game involving blogs as the &#8220;companies&#8221; that one is trading for. I had never been there before, but it sounded interesting so I setup a user there. I was surprised to find out that my blog was [already listed on blogshares.com](http://blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=http%3A%2F%2Fcap.subspacelink.com%2F&user=19060) and that someone has already purchased 4000 shares in it. Further more there are so far 2 changes in stock value of Cap&#8217;s Log, in April it was worth $32.08 a share and in May it was worth $43.58, so that&#8217;s cool. I&#8217;m sure there are much more popular blogs out there but, it&#8217;s cool that I&#8217;m listed.

The annoying thing is, because this is my blog, I get 1000 shares automatically, but someone else has already purchased 4000 shares, so that means that even though this is my site, I only own 20% of the market share of Cap&#8217;s Log&#8230; This is indeed an interesting past time. I intend to buy shares of JMac&#8217;s blog as soon as they become available for purchase
