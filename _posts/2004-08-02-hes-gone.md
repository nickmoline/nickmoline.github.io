David left yesterday to go to Washington (via Canada since all the flights to Seattle and Portland were all overbooked). His flight was delayed, delayed, and delayed again, so that though his original flight was supposed to leave at 4:30, his flight finally took off at 8:05 and arrived Vancover time at almost 11. I got a call well after I went to sleep (3:57 a.m.) from JMac telling me that he had picked up David alright and that they were back in washington.

So I have the house to myself during the weekdays now, the silence is nice.
