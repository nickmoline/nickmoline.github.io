Well all my work on Cap&#8217;s Log has inspired me to do some more image editing. I have now created a new version of the Arcadia Station website. Check out the difference between the <a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060625035925/http://arcadia.stations.acalltoduty.com:80/old/">old version</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://arcadia.stations.acalltoduty.com/">new version</a>.Â  I guess I just got tired of the site that represented the station I am SM for not having any information.Â  I&#8217;m really pleased with the results.
