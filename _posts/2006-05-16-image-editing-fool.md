Well all my work on Cap&#8217;s Log has inspired me to do some more image editing. I have now created a new version of the Arcadia Station website. Check out the difference between the <a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060326012421/http://arcadia.stations.acalltoduty.com/">old version</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060521124319/http://arcadia.stations.acalltoduty.com/">new version</a>.  I guess I just got tired of the site that represented the station I am SM for not having any information.  I&#8217;m really pleased with the results.
