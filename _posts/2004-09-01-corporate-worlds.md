Much of my normal every day life (such as my programming projects like the cabin booking system I&#8217;ve been working on for Pastor Tom, and the writing of my novels) have taken a back seat lately to my continued work on getting PortalKeeper off the ground. Tonight I had a conference call with my business partners and a couple other associates who are working on this project.

In this conversation I showed the results of my searches trying to find average costs for the leasing of the office space and we discussed the other things I&#8217;m going to have to find costs on for our next conference call which is scheduled for 9 p.m. Central Time next Tuesday.
