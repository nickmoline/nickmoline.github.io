Earlier this week I decided to start entering more of the internet culture, I&#8217;ve been a webmaster since 1995 and I&#8217;ve kinda got caught in my old ways when I started doing perl programming and such. I noticed that more recent aspects internet culture have gone ignored by me. Last Friday I started publishing my first Fanfic. Unlike what a lot of you would think, I did NOT base it on the _Star Trek_ universe (perhaps I will write my next fanfic in this universe), but instead I picked a show with lighter content to get started, I picked to base the fanfic on the show _Lizzie McGuire_ (Disney Channel and ABC).

Today I decided that I should perhaps start another popular element of Internet Culture, and that is, the weblog or **blog** as it is commonly known. Now I could have written my own system to do it, and perhaps one day I will, but for now I decided it would be easiest to go with the commonly used Movable Type program, seems simple enough, I intend to play with the templating features of it soon, but for starters this will be a tad plain. I do kinda like the Categories thing, this way I can do things like Personal Logs, Duty Logs, my ACTD Logs, and Fanfic updates and easily identify the difference between them.

So here I am, writing my very first blog entry and it seem somewhat natural actually, why didn&#8217;t I do this a long time ago? I dunno, but I intend to keep this regularly updated.
