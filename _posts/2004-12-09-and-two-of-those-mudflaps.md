As most of you who know me well know, I&#8217;ve had a great deal of difficulty lately with the fact that some checks from a long time closed checking account have gotten into the hands of some vagrants who have decided to go on a several month shopping spree in my name. Last thursday I received a letter from the Tarrant County DA(District Attorney) office stating that if I didn&#8217;t pay off the balance of 6 of those checks within 10 days a warrant would be put out for my arrest.

What follows is the events of Thursday through today in regards to what has happened thusfar in this case.

What follows is a transcript of the letter itself. Note I typed this so formatting is not there. I currently don&#8217;t have a working scanner otherwise I would scan a copy of the letter for you allto read. Here goes:

>           Friday I left the house with my father. We went first down to the Police Station. There I wanted to check on the police report I filed on this matter back in August (August 12<sup>th</sup> to be precise, 2<br /> days after my birthday). I got a copy of the police report summary (Report Number 040054507) and the records clerk said if I have any additional information I should bring it down so they can add it to the report, in hopes that the culprit can be found quickly.

>           Our next stop (after some lunch) was to go to my bank and see what I needed to do in order to get Forgery affidavits. Turns out to get<br /> an affidavit of forgery it has to be for a specific check number.<br /> Well I didn&#8217;t even know how many checks had attempted to be cashed. The bank however was able to search through their online database and find copies of 24 of the checks. They printed out copies of all 24 checks and gave me 24 forgery affidavits, which they notarized.

>           Next I went over to the district office to see if I could get copies of<br /> all 24 checks and all 24 forgery affidavits, I also needed to get a letter (that I had written to the DA) notarized in order to fulfill his requirements in that 3rd to last paragraph. The letter I wrote can be found below:

Copies of all 24 checks have been submitted to the Arlington Police Department in connection with the above Incident Report.<br /> As I do not know which 6 of the 24 total checks are in your department, I am enclosing all 24 Affidavits of Forgery for all currently known written checks. I am also enclosing a copy of the Police Report, and 9 letters from collection agencies that have concluded that the checks in their possession are indeed fraudulent.

Eventually I got up and went over to the desk and started the process of entering in the details of the checks that I now had copies of into an excel spreadsheet, hoping to get a running total of how much money I&#8217;ve been screwed over for as well as seeing if I could find any trends in the checks.

The first was check number <strong>1098</strong>, dated <strong>9-19-04</strong> to <strong>Dominoes Pizza</strong> for <strong>$42.44</strong>. What made this check really stand out among the pile, besides the fact that that was a whole lot of pizza, was the fact that this was obviously a pizza delivary. I know this because Dominoes affixed the Driver Slip to the back of the check before they endorced it.

An office that has a large dumpster out back that I use when my car gets incredibly cluttered and the time comes to clean it out. What must have happened is this:

My car was, once again in a state of disarray, with random papers and things in the back. I stopped one day at the dumpster after doing a consulting job and attempted to clean it out a little. I saw some checks that were now from an account that had been closed since before I moved to North Carolina in the first place and, without thinking clearly (in fact with so little thinking that I don&#8217;t even remember doing it), I threw out the remaining checks in the dumpster. Who should happen upon these checks? But Kimberly Clason, or one of her family members or friends. They said &#8220;woohoo, lookie here, some checks, let&#8217;s go on a shopping spree&#8221; and that&#8217;s just what they did.</em>

This check was obviously to be cashed, rather then just buying groceries because the store made him stick his thumbprint on the back and then stamped around the thumbprint a stamp saying &#8220;AUTHENTIPRINT&#8221;. So I have one check with a verifiable name, address, and phone number attached, and another one with a fingerprint.

>                               Monday I call the police station and ask if it would be possible to talk to the detective in charge of my case (they had told me at the records office that a detective is assigned to every case) and was shortly told that no detective has been assigned (remember, I filed this report back in <strong>August</strong>) because they don&#8217;t assign detectives to these types of cases until a merchant complains. A Merchant has obviously complained because I got the above letter from the District Attorney, but still no detective has been assigned to my case, and nobody will talk to me, so even though I have loads of evidence that could help find the people actually responsible for this crime, nobody will talk to me, I can&#8217;t show it to anyone, and I still face the possibility that I may be going to jail.
