I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to moving my site onto nick.pro and off of capslog.info (which should now redirect to nick.pro).  I&#8217;ve long wanted to focus on this more professional domain name, so I&#8217;m very much looking forward to improving this site as time goes on.

Also in the process, I&#8217;ve finally upgraded to the new shiny WordPress 2.3.1 and am having fun tagging my old articles.
