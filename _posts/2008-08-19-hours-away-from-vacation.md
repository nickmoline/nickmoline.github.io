I&#8217;m mere hours away from taking a little vacation to Las Vegas along with my wife, and my roommate. Tomorrow morning I will board a Virgin America flight (I&#8217;m much looking forward to trying them out), for Las Vegas.

I&#8217;ve got a lot of fun planned, including one last trip to the Star Trek Experience in the Las Vegas Hilton. In fact making a final voyage to the Experience was my <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.holodeck3.com/event/2008/08/21/holodeck-3-meetup-star-trek-experience">primary reason</span> for visiting Vegas this month. This will be my fourth Voyage there (blogged about before on my blog, I&#8217;ll edit this post with links to my old posts later), and I&#8217;m sad it will be my last, but unfortunately the Experience will be [Closing on September 1st](http://trekmovie.com/2008/06/29/star-trek-the-experience-closing-in-september/) permanently, so I had to make one last trip. This will be Mike&#8217;s first trip to the future, and he&#8217;s eager to see what he has only heard about.

But this trip won&#8217;t be all Star Trek, on Thursday Night, Barbara and I will be seeing Mamma Mia. We&#8217;ve seen the movie and are both looking forward to seeing the play as well. On Friday Night we will be going Medievil, and enjoying the Tournament of Kings at the Excalibur, another great treat.

In addition to all that planned fun, we are also going to get to see my parents, who are in Vegas right now, and our vacation plans are thankfully overlapping enough that we can see each other.

I&#8217;m looking forward to a very enjoyable trip.
