I&#8217;ve talked before about <a href="https://www.nick.pro/2011/08/27/pottermore-cheats-earning-more-house-points-through-failure-then-success-in-potion-making/" target="_blank">Pottermore</a>, the website by <a href="http://www.jkrowling.com/" target="_blank">J.K. Rowling</a> and <a href="http://www.think.eu/" target="_blank">TH_NK</a>.  Well according to the <a href="http://insider.pottermore.com/2012/03/waiting-for-pottermore.html" target="_blank">Pottermore Insider blog</a>, the site will go live on April 1st, it isn&#8217;t clear if this means that the ebooks will finally be available on that date too, although I hope so.  Of course, April 1st is well known to be April Fools Day.  And Rowling herself has been known to acknowledge the fun of an April Fools Joke (Fred and George Weasley were &#8220;of course&#8221; born on April Fools Day), so announcing an April 1st release date could be a very cruel joke.  Here&#8217;s hoping it&#8217;s true!
