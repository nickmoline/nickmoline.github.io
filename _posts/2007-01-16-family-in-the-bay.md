Well we have had our first Family member visit the area of our new home in California. Barbara&#8217;s Dad, who is a truck driver now had to deliver a shipment in San Leandro, CA (just on the other side of the bay near Oakland) and so Barbara and I drove across the bay (our first time crossing the bay in a car, we drove around it a couple times) to spend a few hours with him. We had dinner at a Chili&#8217;s and just had a nice Sunday.
