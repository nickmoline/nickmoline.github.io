Well I&#8217;ve decided that if this site is going to truly be a way for people to find out about my life I should follow the example set by my friends <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.jmaclabs.com/gallery/">JMac</span> and <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.johnsonjournal.net/gallery/">Dann Johnson</span> and add a [photo gallery](http://cap.subspacelink.com/gallery/){.broken_link} to my site, so go [check it out today](http://cap.subspacelink.com/gallery/){.broken_link}. I&#8217;ve been busy since last night and so far I&#8217;ve uploaded 468 images into 25 albums (6 top level albums and various sub albums).
