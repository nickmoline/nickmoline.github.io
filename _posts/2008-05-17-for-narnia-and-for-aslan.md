[My Wife, Barbara](http://www.barbara.pro), and I, as well as our roommate [Mike](http://www.goosite.net/), just got back home from seeing <span class="removed_link" title="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/narnia/">The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian</span>, and it was fantastic! I&#8217;m not going to say much about it here, because I&#8217;m intending on recording an episode of _The Looking Glass_ on Wizards.FM tomorrow, in which we&#8217;ll give our more complete review, but it definitely was worth seeing, and I highly recommend it to everyone.
