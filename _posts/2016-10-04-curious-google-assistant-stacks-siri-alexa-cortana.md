I did a wrap up of how [the Google Assistant compares with its competitors at Apple, Microsoft and Amazon](https://onward.justia.com/2016/10/04/google-assistant-battle/) for Justia&#8217;s Legal Marketing & Technology Blog.  My brief overview discusses what each of the Digital Personal Assistants brought to the table, and how Google has taken what they see as the best aspect of each and added their own flair.
