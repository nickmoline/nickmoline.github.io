Last week I attended the MacWorld Conference and Expo 2008 in San Francisco as I did last year. The reason I did not write a post on my blog for the event however is because I&#8217;m pleased to announce that I have written an [article reviewing MacWorld](http://www.llrx.com/features/macworld.htm){.broken_link} for the distinguished e-zine, [LLRX](http://www.llrx.com/) (The Law Librarian Resource Exchange). I&#8217;ve always had an itch to get into journalism and the publication of my first article in a respected online magazine is a very exciting announcement for me.

Check out my [review of MacWorld 2008 at llrx.com](http://www.llrx.com/features/macworld.htm){.broken_link}.
