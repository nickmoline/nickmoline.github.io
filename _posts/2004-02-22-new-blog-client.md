I didn&#8217;t mention this yesterday but I am now using a new client for MT called <a target="_blank" title="Zempt" href="http://zempt.org/">Zempt</a> to update this blog.

This is a great program, <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.jmaclabs.com/blog/">JMac</span> pointed this program out to me saying it is what he favors using on windows. I must agree. Nothing against <a target="_blank" title="w.bloggar" href="http://www.bloggar.com/">w.bloggar</a> but it just didn&#8217;t support everything that zempt does.

In other news, I&#8217;ve gone through all my old blog entries and renamed all of the entries that had a title like &#8220;Personal Log &#8211; Stardate&#8230;&#8221;, first of all that&#8217;s dorky, and second of all I think titles should be understandable, I mean I may want to go back and find a blog entry one day, if I don&#8217;t name the entries with logical names that may become difficult. I&#8217;ve also done some changes to the categories for future category logging.
