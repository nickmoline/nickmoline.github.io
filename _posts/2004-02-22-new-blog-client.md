I didn't mention this yesterday but I am now using a new client for MT called <a target="_blank" title="Zempt" href="http://zempt.org/">Zempt</a> to update this blog.

This is a great program, [JMac](http://www.jmaclabs.com/) pointed this program out to me saying it is what he favors using on windows. I must agree. Nothing against w.bloggar but it just didn't support everything that zempt does.

In other news, I've gone through all my old blog entries and renamed all of the entries that had a title like &#8220;Personal Log &#8211; Stardate&#8230;&#8221;, first of all that's dorky, and second of all I think titles should be understandable, I mean I may want to go back and find a blog entry one day, if I don't name the entries with logical names that may become difficult. I've also done some changes to the categories for future category logging.
