It seems I left off at least one state in my map last week of the places I have been. I have also been to Georgia, I am searching my memory to try and recall if I have been to South Carolina or not, I think I have, but until I remember a specific instance, I&#8217;m going to leave that one uncolored.

I&#8217;ve also registered as a member on world66.com now which allows this nifty multicolor world map. Dark red means I&#8217;ve lived in this country, lighter red means I&#8217;ve visited this country, dark Grey means I WANT to visit this country, and light Grey means I have not visited this country nor do I have any plans to visit this country. Of course plans change and just because I don&#8217;t have your country highlighted dark Grey doesn&#8217;t mean I may not want to visit there one day, I just don&#8217;t currently have any plans to do so.
