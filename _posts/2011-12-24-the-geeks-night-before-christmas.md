Last night I was trying to think about where to put my stocking, and when it dawned on me to put it on the shelf above the TV, it inspired me to write this parody.  I hope you enjoy it.

_  
Twas the Night before Christmas, and in the Geek&#8217;s House  
The only thing stirring was the Geek&#8217;s mouse_

[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-534" title="The Stocking was hung by the Plasma with care" alt="The Stocking was hung by the Plasma with care" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.nick.pro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMAG0124-168x300.jpg?resize=168%2C300&#038;ssl=1" width="168" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" />](https://i2.wp.com/www.nick.pro/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMAG0124.jpg?ssl=1)_The stocking was hung by the Plasma with care,_  
_In hopes that [UPS](http://www.ups.com/) soon would be there;_

_He was busy coding, no time for bed_  
_Visions of source code, danced through his head_

_Wearing a [thinkgeek t-shirt](http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/unisex/popculture/e60f/){.broken_link}, and a [Tux cap](http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/hats-ties/2998/){.broken_link},_  
_He [tracked Santa Claus](http://www.noradsanta.org/) on the Google Earth App_

_When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,_  
_He clicked straight to [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) to research the matter._

_News site and blog he clicked like a flash,_  
_When nothing he found, to the front door he dashed._

_When, what to his wondering eyes should appear_  
_but a big brown truck, it was finally here!_

_With a little old driver, so lively and quick,_  
_A UPS man, did you think St. Nick?_

_More rapid than eagles, his charges they came,_  
_The Geek whistled, and shouted, and called them by name_

_From [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/?&tag=capslog-20&camp=211493&creative=379973&linkCode=ez&adid=1PRSNK7GXJ04D1CX9FWZ&), [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/), [ThinkGeek](http://www.thinkgeek.com/){.broken_link} and [Zappos](http://www.zappos.com/),_  
_Great gifts bought online, he wondered who sent those._

_The man brought them out and stacked them up high_  
_So many presents, they reached to the sky._

_He had a broad face, and a little round belly_  
_That shook when he laugh&#8217;d, like a bowl full of jelly_

_When finally done with stacking straight as a line_  
_he brought out a clipboard and pen and said, &#8220;Sign&#8221;_

_Then placing one finger aside of his nose,_  
_The man gave a nod and into the truck he rose_

_He turned his key, and drove down the lane_  
_The geek looked down at brown packages plain_

_He opened the first, and smiled when inside_  
_An iPod from his mother, wrapping paper did hide_

_The second he found, was a Blu-Ray from a friend_  
_Such generosity, his heart it did mend_

_Boxes and boxes, each one he did ope&#8217;._  
_Each tech gift filled him with joy and hope_

_My story is done, to me it did Psych_
