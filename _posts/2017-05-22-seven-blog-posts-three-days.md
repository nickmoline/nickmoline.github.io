Last week Barbara and I attended the annual Google I/O Developer&#8217;s conference in Mountain View. &nbsp;We&#8217;ve attended every year since the [first one](https://www.nick.pro/2008/06/01/google-io-part-1-google-app-engine/) back in 2008 and were glad to continue the streak.

As you may have noticed from my last few short posts here, I&#8217;ve been [doing more writing](https://onward.justia.com/author/nickmoline/) over on Justia&#8217;s Legal Marketing & Technology Blog this year than in years past and as such I proposed the idea of live blogging sessions at Google I/O this year. &nbsp;My suggestion was readily approved and I set to work on [planning which sessions I would Live Blog](https://onward.justia.com/2017/05/10/google-io-2017-live-blog/).

In the end I Live Blogged 7 &nbsp;sessions over the course of the 3 day conference and wanted to make sure those that follow me on my personal blog knew about them. &nbsp;Check out the list of sessions I ended up blogging, with links over to the individual live blog posts after the break.
