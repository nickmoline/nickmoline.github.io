_Note &#8211; May 2006 &#8211; This is the third blog entry I have found in my editing of my blog that has been edited by my ex-girlfriend trying to remove the header of the message.Â  This post used to be a lovely reminder of the high point of my relationship with her, which despite the horrible endings and how vindictive and mean she became after the relationship ended, I still would like to remember the good times.Â  Plus this post was written on a day when I was very sick and about to lose my job and yet it was a message of a day that was actually kind of nice._

I was woken up at 5:30 in the afternoon by my mother calling me as she entered the house saying I had 2 packages on the front porch waiting for me. They were both from my Girlfriend containing gifts she had sent me. She sent me 3 stuffed bears, a framed picture of herself, a wallet sized version of the same picture, a Valentines Day Card, a letter, and a poem that she wrote. It really warmed my heart to receive these gifts of her love. I love you Imzadi, more each and every day.

I need to build a shelf over my piano to place these tokens of her love so that I can look at them from my bed and remember her love (except for the wallet sized picture, which I&#8217;ll keep with me)

Later when I finally opened up my laptop I was doing my normal rounds through my various e-mail accounts and noticed something in my main ACTD e-mail account. It was a notification that my character Lieutenant Junior Grade Cap (Bynar) was promoted to the rank of full Lieutenant. At the time of the actual game on the <span class="removed_link" title="http://scorpius.ships.acalltoduty.com/">Scorpius</span> my character didn&#8217;t have that much to do during the mission but there was a nice brief ceremony following the mission when his promotion was noted.

Plus I&#8217;m back to bloggin, this being my second blog entry of the day (although it&#8217;s now 2:22 a.m. so it&#8217;s really a new day) so all in all, it&#8217;s been a very nice day.
