When I was young (somewhere in the early/mid &#8217;90s), I saw some program (I don&#8217;t know which) on PBS and they were talking about some guy (I can&#8217;t find the program, and don&#8217;t remember names, but I presume it was either [Thad Starner](http://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/lizzy/timeline.html#1993a) or [Steve Mann](http://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/lizzy/timeline.html#1994d)) at MIT who is wearing a computer with a Head Mounted Display and a single hand keyboard, and a computer kept in some sort of backpack.  At that point I knew 2 things.

1. Wearable Computing is a future I want to be a part of.
2. MIT was where I wanted to go to college.

Now sadly I never got to attend MIT, in fact other than a little time at Tarrant County College (formerly Tarrant County Junior College) in which I didn&#8217;t even earn an associates degree, I didn&#8217;t get to go to college at all.  But I wanted to go to MIT

This past week I&#8217;ve been attending the [24th Annual CALI Conference for Law School Computing](http://conference.cali.org/2014/){.broken_link} at Harvard Law School. As usual the conference was a blast and I have enjoyed checking out Harvard.

But what was especially exciting for me was getting a chance to visit MIT. That PBS special 20 years ago is a big part of what set me on my path towards becoming a programmer. As well as making me as fascinated as I was towards technology and the future.

As I stood in front of the main building of MIT, wearing Google Glass and posing for pictures with Tim and Mayra, it struck me that I was there. I was wearing a computer at MIT. True, I was never a student of the esteemed university, and also true that I wasn&#8217;t on a team making that wearable computer, but as a glass explorer, I have been working with the team that did over the past year, providing feedback, testing it, going to events, developing apps.

And as a software engineer at Justia, I work with technology every day, and I get to work on projects that make a real difference in the world, making legal information more accessible to everyone. I may not be MIT educated, but my real dream of working with the future of technology is real, and I&#8217;m living it #ThroughGlass

Couple quick closing thoughts&#8230; First, If the man in the video I watched 2 decades ago was indeed Thad Starner, than it is extra cool because he is a [Technical Lead/Manager on Google&#8217;s Project Glass](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/) which means in the above picture I am literally wearing the culmination of his work from the project I was watching the video about in the first place.

And finally. If you walk around a frosted glass with MIT on it and look at it from behind. It says &#8220;Tim.&#8221; My boss approves.
