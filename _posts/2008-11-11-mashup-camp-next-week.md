Dan did rather well, scoring 4th place with his iPhoneLocator Facebook App (although he&#8217;s rather disappointed as only the first 3 places won prizes), and I unfortunately came in last place. I haven&#8217;t decided if I&#8217;m going to compete again or not, but I can guarantee you if I do, I refuse to get last place again.

This years event looks like it will be fun however, including a [Keynote](http://www.mashupcamp.com/mountain-view-november/schedule.php) by [Tim O&#8217;Reilly](http://radar.oreilly.com/tim/), Founder and CEO of [O&#8217;Reilly Media](http://oreilly.com/), which, among other things the company does, is my favorite publisher of Technology books.

I&#8217;m way behind blogging about this, as [Dan blogged about it back in August](http://www.vuquoc.com/2008/08/29/mashup-camp-7-mountain-view-ca/){.broken_link}
