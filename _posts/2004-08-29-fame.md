Well further to my message yesterday, it seems I have a new claim to fame.

<!--more-->

For 1 minute today I owned 38.5% of Slashdot in the Blogshares fantasy stock market.

Confused? Of course you are, allow me to explain. At 12:09 p.m. Central time today I received the following e-mail:

> You have been given 186000 shares in SlashDot.Org by PaperFrog  
> http://blogshares.com/user.php?id=6629
> 
> Check your profile here: http://blogshares.com/user.php?id=19060 . Mesage from player:
> 
> Have fun with these shares or their proceeds

Now Slashdot only has 482500 shares total. Doing the math (186000/482500*100) I come up with the detail that I owned 38.549223% of Slashdot.org. Very cool, I owned a sizable percentage of one of the most popular geek sites on the net. A Claim to fame. But one minute later (at 12:10) I received 3 e-mails in quick succession:

> You were forced to sell 18600 out of the 186000 shares you own in SlashDot.Org for B$1,985.24 ea. (3x the current market price) because Jorge Yau restructured the blog using a Anne Frank&#8217;s Diary (artefact).
> 
> Your account has been credited a total of B$36,925,534.80 for this transaction which brings it to B$36,925,594.05. http://blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slashdot.org%2F

> You were forced to sell 26784 out of the 167400 shares you own in SlashDot.Org for B$1,985.24 ea. (3x the current market price) because Jorge Yau restructured the blog using a Bloggers (artefact).
> 
> Your account has been credited a total of B$53,172,769.70 for this transaction which brings it to B$90,098,363.12. http://blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slashdot.org%2F

> Your 140616 shares in SlashDot.Org were sold at B$1,985.24 ea. (3 x B$661.75 &#8211; the current price) because Jorge Yau performed a hostile takeover using a Bon Vivant (artefact).
> 
> Your account has been credited a total of B$279,157,037.62 for this transaction which brings it to B$369,255,400.74.

So I only owned 38% of slashdot for less then 1 minute, but the end result was that I ended up with B$369 million. Pretty good considering yesterday I had B$500. In [my profile on blogshares.com](http://blogshares.com/user.php?id=19060) it says that I have: **73,916,391.64%** growth in net worth this month. Now if only the real stock market worked so well that someone could start with $500 and have $369 million 24 hours later&#8230;..

So anyway&#8230; Much thanks to PaperFrog for the massive gift on Blogshares. As for Jorge Yau, even though you took something really cool from me, thank you anyway cause when you forced me to sell to you, you forced me to sell at tripple the market value so I ended up with a lot of B$ in that transaction.
