So tonight was fun.. Amazing how things can bring back both such fond and such painful memories at the same time. I went to a play tonight, &#8220;25th Annual Putnum County Spelling Bee&#8221; and they were looking for volunteer spellers and I was chosen.

Fond memories of being on stage again, little bit of improv involved as I had to play along with the actors.

As for the painful memories, just like the last spelling bee I got out on my first word. It was such a hard word I don&#8217;t even remember what it was, the other 3 volunteers had easy words their first rounds (one of them had Cow, another Fandango) but me not so much.

Entertaining though, when the volunteer asked them to use &#8220;Fandango&#8221; in a sentence, the sentence was:

&#8220;I see a little silhouetto of a man, Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango.&#8221;

Gotta love a Queen reference.
