Earlier this month, I wrote about [tracking mentions of yourself on twitter](https://www.nick.pro/2009/03/06/twitter-tip-better-replies-in-tweetdeck/ "Twitter Tip: A Better @replies List in TweetDeck") more completly then just checking the <a href="http://twitter.com/replies" target="_blank">@replies tab on twitter</a> (or in tweetdeck).Â  Keeping tabs on what people say about you in twitter is only one step in effectively tracking references to yourself online.

So here&#8217;s step 2, if you want to really know what people are saying about you online, take the search a step further and check out what is being said about you on blogs.

Here is a slightly modified version of the same search string I used on Twitter to track mentions of me.

> &#8220;Nicholas Moline&#8221; OR &#8220;Nick Moline&#8221; OR NickMoline OR link:nick.pro -site:nick.pro

<p style="text-align: left">
  Now when I <a title="Find Nick in Google Blogsearch" href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?scoring=d&q=%22Nicholas+Moline%22+OR+%22Nick+Moline%22+OR+NickMoline+OR+link%3Anick.pro+-site%3Anick.pro" target="_blank">plug this search in at Google Blogsearch</a>, I see mentions of me on blogs around the web.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
  Think of -site:nick.pro the same way we thought of -from:NickMoline on the twitter search, it is pointless to see mentions of my own name on my own site, so I quickly filter out my domain name from the results.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
  The link:nick.pro is similar to to:NickMoline on twitter search, by adding in &#8220;OR link:nick.pro&#8221; I will get posts that link to me even if they don&#8217;t mention me by name.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
  Once I had the results, I sorted by date, and then clicked the link on the bottom of the page to view the feed in Google Reader, now whenever someone mentions me on their blogs, I&#8217;ll be notified as soon as Google ads the post to their index.
