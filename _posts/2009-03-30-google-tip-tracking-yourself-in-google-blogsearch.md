Earlier this month, I wrote about [tracking mentions of yourself on twitter]({% page_url 2009-03-06-twitter-tip-better-replies-in-tweetdeck %} "Twitter Tip: A Better @replies List in TweetDeck") more completly then just checking the <a href="http://twitter.com/replies" target="_blank">@replies tab on twitter</a> (or in tweetdeck).Â  Keeping tabs on what people say about you in twitter is only one step in effectively tracking references to yourself online.

So here&#8217;s step 2, if you want to really know what people are saying about you online, take the search a step further and check out what is being said about you on blogs.

Here is a slightly modified version of the same search string I used on Twitter to track mentions of me.

```
"Nicholas Moline" OR "Nick Moline" OR NickMoline OR link:nick.pro -site:nick.pro
```

Now when I <a title="Find Nick in Google Blogsearch" href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?scoring=d&q=%22Nicholas+Moline%22+OR+%22Nick+Moline%22+OR+NickMoline+OR+link%3Anick.pro+-site%3Anick.pro" target="_blank">plug this search in at Google Blogsearch</a>, I see mentions of me on blogs around the web.

Think of `-site:nick.pro` the same way we thought of `-from:NickMoline` on the twitter search, it is pointless to see mentions of my own name on my own site, so I quickly filter out my domain name from the results.

The `link:nick.pro` is similar to `to:NickMoline` on twitter search, by adding in `OR link:nick.pro` I will get posts that link to me even if they don&#8217;t mention me by name.

Once I had the results, I sorted by date, and then clicked the link on the bottom of the page to view the feed in Google Reader, now whenever someone mentions me on their blogs, I&#8217;ll be notified as soon as Google ads the post to their index.
