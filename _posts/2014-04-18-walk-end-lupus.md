As many of you know my wife [Barbara](http://www.barbara.pro/ "Barbara Moline") has Lupus and in October she [experienced a flare up](http://www.barbara.pro/2013/11/lupus-flare-part-1-before-the-hospital/) of her lupus that put her into the hospital.  Before this flare up occurred however, I was already planning on doing a 5K charity walk called the Walk to End Lupus Now.  After the flare up occurred it became even more important to me to participate in the walk and raise money to help fund Lupus research and awareness.  Me and my boss Tim walked the 5K and I&#8217;m proud to say the two of us [raised $1600](http://lupus.donorpages.com/SanFrancisco2013/moline/){.broken_link} for the Lupus Foundation.

This coming October I will be participating in the walk again.  If you would like to sponsor me in my walk, you can do so [at my donor page for the event here](http://lupus2014.nick.pro).  If you want to help even more though, I encourage you to get out there and walk with me.  You can [Join Team Moline](http://lupus.moline.pro/){.broken_link} and  walk with me at the [2014 San Francisco Walk to End Lupus Now](http://lupus.donorpages.com/SanFrancisco2014/){.broken_link} on Sunday October 26, 2014 in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.  If you aren&#8217;t in the bay area but want to walk to raise awareness and money for Lupus Research, the Lupus Foundation [hosts walks](http://www.lupus.org/action/walk-to-end-lupus-now) around the country throughout the year.

Just last week Barbara had what is expected to be her last (6th) Chemotherapy treatment of this particular flare up and the doctor is optimistic that this particular flare up is under control.  This is a tremendous blessing to hear as her previous flare up when she was 12 required 15 Chemotherapy treatments over the course of 3 years.  The doctor is also slowly stepping down Barbara&#8217;s dosage of Prednisone (steroids).  She is now taking just 1 20 milligram pill per day.  At the height of the flare up she was taking 60 milligrams per day.

If you would like to know more about Lupus and how it effects people who have it, I encourage you to check out [Barbara&#8217;s story on her blog](http://www.barbara.pro/2013/11/lupus-flare-part-1-before-the-hospital/), and you can also read more about [Lupus at the Lupus Foundation of America](http://www.lupus.org/) Website at [lupus.org](http://www.lupus.org/).
