Today was my pre-op appointment with the surgeon to make sure I&#8217;m all set for surgery.  When I stepped on the scale (which looked just like the one pictured on the right) today I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I&#8217;m down to **406.7**.  This means I&#8217;ve lost **83.5** pounds total so far and I haven&#8217;t even had the surgery yet.

Surgery is scheduled for Thursday, July 26, 2012.

I attribute the accelerated weight loss to the liquid only diet the surgeon has me on leading up to the surgery date.
