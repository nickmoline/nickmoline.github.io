I would like to honor my Father, Richard V. Moline III, who served this country in the US Navy before I was born.

I would like to honor my Sister in Law, Betina Garcia, who currently serves this country as an Army Corporal.

I would like to honor the memory my Uncle, James Carr, who like my father, also served in the U.S. Navy.

I would like to honor the memory of wife&#8217;s Grandfather, Therman Branning, who served in World War 2, including as a member of the U.S. Army Cleanup Crew after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

I would like to honor my Uncle Herman Jones, who recently returned from Iraq where he was a member of the team training Iraqi Police Officers

I also would like to honor my friends who have served this country,

I would like to honor John Savage, who I worked with at GetOnTheAir, who served as an Army Ranger in Iraq.

I honor my old school friend Josh Brown who I know currently serves this country, though I don&#8217;t know with which branch of the military.

I know there are many more to honor who have served or are serving, and I&#8217;m very sorry if I forgot you in this post. I am very proud of everyone who has served this country.  God bless all of you.

Thank you to everyone who served in the U.S. Military, not just those I&#8217;ve listed here, but every single man and woman who has put on a uniform.  I owe my safety and security in this country to the sacrifice you&#8217;ve given to us.
