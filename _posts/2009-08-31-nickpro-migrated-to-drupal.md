I have successfully migrated the nick.pro site from the WordPress blog that it has been for ages, into Drupal. This is perhaps the most unusual migration of this blog (and I&#8217;ve moved this blog several times now), in that I don&#8217;t actually consider Drupal to be a better blogging software then WordPress, in fact, I find WordPress to be the absolute best blogging software available today. However I&#8217;ve long wanted nick.pro to be something more then just a blog, I&#8217;ve wanted it to be a whole site showcasing what I&#8217;m up to online and off, and Drupal is a far better CMS platform for a more robust site then just a blog.

While Drupal works fine as a blog, where it really shines is in it&#8217;s flexibility. There are [Third Party Modules](http://www.drupal.org/project/Modules/){.broken_link} available to do almost anything you can imagine, and for those things you can&#8217;t imagine, it&#8217;s a robust php framework for coding my own modules to do even more incredible things.

For the moment, all I&#8217;ve accomplished is migrating my old blog content, making sure all of the URLs redirect correctly, and adding an activity stream to show my recent activity on various online sites ([twitter](http://twitter.com/nickmoline), [digg](http://digg.com/users/portalcap){.broken_link}, [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/portalcap), and [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nickmoline/) to start, more to come).

This is far from the first time I have migrated my blog. Stay tuned after the break for a brief glimpse of how this site has progressed from &#8220;Cap&#8217;s Log&#8221; on Movable Type 2, to Nick.pro running on Drupal today.

[Originally](https://www.nick.pro/2003/07/11/pop-into-internet-pop-culture), this blog (which used to be a subdomain of subspacelink.com) ran on Movable Type 2, which at the time was an excellent platform (and still is in it&#8217;s version 4 update). At the time I was primarily a perl developer, so it made sense to standardize on a perl platform, I quite enjoyed finding [Plugins](https://www.nick.pro/2004/02/22/mt-plugins){.broken_link} for MT and even writing a few of my own.

Nearly a full year after the blog launched, [I made it&#8217;s first major migration](https://www.nick.pro/story/2004/06/28/blogcms-v30-xe){.broken_link} to [BLOG:CMS](http://blogcms.com/), which is based on the [Nucleus CMS](http://nucleuscms.org/) Blogging platform. My primary reason for this migration was that I could no longer upgrade Movable Type without paying a license fee, and as I much preferred Open Source software, I decided the time had come to migrate to a new platform.

Unfortunately Nucleus never quite seemed a clean enough system for me, and BLOG:CMS made it much messier, and [upgrades to new versions were a real pain](https://www.nick.pro/2004/07/22/busily-updating){.broken_link}, so I was always on the lookout for another blogging platform to switch to.

The Nucleus system was such a pain to work with, that eventually I just stopped blogging entirely, and there came a point where there was a space of over 15 months with not a single post. Eventually I [Migrated to WordPress](https://www.nick.pro/2006/05/01/521600-minutes-how-do-you-measure-year){.broken_link} in May, 2006 and used it continually until today.

As I said above, WordPress is a phenomenal blogging software, the best there is, and I will miss some of it&#8217;s simplicity and functionality on my site now that I have [Gone Drupal](http://www.drupal.org/){.broken_link}, but the time has come that I want more out of my personal site then a blog, and Drupal will give me the flexibility I need to do much more with my site then ever before.
