_(This is a retroactive post, this post is written from the perspective of the day it occurred, Saturday, but was not posted until Sunday)_

This is a story about depression, but unlike previous posts about depression, this depression has absolutely nothing to do with me. I&#8217;m talking about the Great Depression of the 1930s. I say I&#8217;m talking about it, I should be saying the play my brother was just in was talking about it. <!--more--> Today my brother was at Martin High School along with several other schools to compete in the UIL One Act Play 2004 acting competition for District 5A-7, the play his school selected was 

_**&#8220;The American Clock&#8221;**_ by Arthur Miller (Produced through special arrangement by Dramatists Play Service). David played the part of Lee Baum, a lad with high aspirations to write for a newspaper who&#8217;s dreams are shattered by the Great Depression.

David&#8217;s school did their perform ace first so after David was done with his part of the program, Dad and I left, rather then watch the other 6 schools do their performances which would have kept us there all the way who knows how long. The play was good but as Dad and I were leaving the theater dad said

> &#8220;That was good, kind of depressing though&#8221;  
> To which I answered &#8220;What do you expect from a play about the Great Depression&#8221;  
> &#8220;Oh is that why they call it the depression?&#8221; he answered back sarcastically.  
> &#8220;DUH!&#8221;

Good play, I&#8217;ll have to check out to see if there&#8217;s a longer version available, this seemed rather short and condensed.

One thing that struck me was the location. Martin&#8217;s auditorium is not as nice as Seguin&#8217;s (David&#8217;s School) where I&#8217;ve seen his previous plays. The chairs are older, an ugly shade of orange, and very very small, I felt like I was sitting in a grade school auditorium rather then a high school&#8217;s. No consideration for fat people such as myself at all, how annoying.
