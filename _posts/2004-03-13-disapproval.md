Lately I&#8217;ve been feeling like I&#8217;m completely unwanted. My parents aren&#8217;t proud of me (and why should they be, I&#8217;m unemployed and living at home, how pathetic), and though I&#8217;m sending out resumes and job applications by the stack, I have yet to get much of any response from them.

I hate the feeling of rejection, well of course I do, everyone hates rejection, but rejection has always been something I have struggled with. Also feelings of failure. In case you are wondering why I haven&#8217;t posted any blog entries in the last week and a half, well besides the fact that I&#8217;ve been very busy, I just don&#8217;t feel that anything I&#8217;m doing is worth a blog entry.

Meaningless, everything is meaningless. I have no job, I have no purpose, it&#8217;s all just meaningless.
