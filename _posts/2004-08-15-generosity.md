I am starting a new category in this blog called Praises. Here I will report some good things that are happening in my life, this way I can hit the Praises category button and look back at the blessings in my life.

Yesterday _(well Friday, so now the day before yesterday)_ I was working at the SWDCMA office fixing a broken outlook client _(Yes, I know, from our techie perspectives all outlook clients are broken, but in this case she had lost all of her e-mail, contacts, calendar, you name it, she lost it)_. After I was finished, Iris gave me a lift home. On the way we stopped at Fry&#8217;s Electronics so I could help pick out what Battery Backup they will need to keep their server operational in power outages (their current server just isn&#8217;t cutting it).

After that stop, and the quick drive the rest of the way home I entered the house and went to check the messages on the answering machine.

On the machine was a message for me to call Bridget, a lady from ERCC who run&#8217;s the Compassion Team. I called her back and she told me that she had heard that I [Needed Tires](http://cap.subspacelink.com/?itemid=77). Her husband owns a Firestone store in Fort Worth and they generously were going to provide those tires for me.

Not only did they provide tires and realign my system, but because I was on my doughnut, Bridget drove in front of me so that if I were to get another flat on the way, there would be someone there to help me.

I am truly grateful for this great help in my time of need.
