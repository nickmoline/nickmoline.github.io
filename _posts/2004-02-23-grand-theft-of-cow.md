I was just watching <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techlive.com/" class="broken_link">TechLive</a>, not really paying attention while I worked on trying to diagnose memory leaks on a server but something they said caught my ear. They were talking about Cattle Rangling (Stealing Cattle) and mentioned the new technology they are using to stop them. They mentioned that the culprit was caught and charged with several counts of &#8220;Grand Theft of Cow.&#8221; I just had to post that, it was such a wierd statement.
