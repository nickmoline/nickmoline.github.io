What I meant to mention in my earlier post but neglected to say because I started ranting is that the latest thing to bug me in my life is the fact that I had been very much looking forward to my brother visiting me today from TX, but his flight was cancelled and he couldn&#8217;t come. The flights aren&#8217;t looking very good for tomorrow either so I am not sure if he will make it tomorrow either.

Well I thought that I should write another chapter of Miles Apart because if my brother catches me writing a Lizzie McGuire fanfic he would tease me relentlessly, so I figured I&#8217;d get another chapter in before he came to hold me over till I had some privacy again. Unfortunately I have come across something that I haven&#8217;t had before while writing this story, a slight case of writers block. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t have ideas on how to continue the story, in actuality I have 4 completely different ideas on how to continue from this point, and I&#8217;m having the hardest time deciding between them&#8230;. perhaps I could do a multiple reality storyline and try them all? Or not, that&#8217;s too confusing, I think I&#8217;ll just have to spend a little while to decide on one of them, perhaps I&#8217;ll write it later tonight.
