I&#8217;m attending the [Developing Extensions for Google Chrome](http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions/DevelopingExtensionsGoogleChrome.html){.broken_link} session right now, which is hosted by [Aaron Boodman](http://code.google.com/events/io/speakers.html#aa){.broken_link} who is noted for being the creator of the [Greasemonkey Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748) and who now works at Google, and is working on Chrome Extensions. He Started this session with a disclaimer &#8220;This is alpha code, we are not announcing Extensions for Chrome today&#8221; (see my [Tweet of Disappointment](http://twitter.com/NickMoline/status/1938360780) at that).

That said, the way extensions are handled in Google Chrome is actually really cool. Extensions are very simple to implement, and I&#8217;m probably going to write some development Chrome Extensions as early as this week, unfortunately no NORMAL user of Chrome will be able to install it (only people using the dev release of chrome and who manually install it can use them). Still interesting, but my exclamation of February that earned me lots of pageviews as it showed up on Techcrunch, CNET, Lifehacker, and Mashable (and many others), was unfortunately wrong, and I&#8217;m not to big to admit it (certainly if I didn&#8217;t admit it, someone would do so in the comments, and rightfully so).

Am I totally disappointed? In this yes, but in I/O, for one thing, it was announced during the keynote today that [every attendee of I/O gets a free **unlocked** Android Mobile Phone](http://twitter.com/NickMoline/status/1938126329), WITH a free month of unlimited voice and data service on it, very cool.

**UPDATE:** The Session video is now up on youtube, I&#8217;ve embedded it below:
