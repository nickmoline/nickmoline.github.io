1 Year ago today, I went to El Camino Hospital to [have my Gastric Sleeve surgery]({% post_url 2012-07-26-midnight-t-10-hours-go-time-stop-drinking-water %} "Midnight, T-10 hours to go, time to stop drinking water").  One year later I have lost 96 pounds since the Surgery, a total of 195 pounds since I started my weight loss journey.  It&#8217;s a shame I didn&#8217;t quite make it to 200 pounds total loss, but I&#8217;m very proud of my weight loss progress and I&#8217;m nowhere near done.

Today to celebrate my 1 year anniversary from the surgery I took a day of PTO to have a little stay-cation.  Now the old me would have used an anniversary celebration as a reason for cake, ice cream, or other treats, but this is an anniversary of weight-loss surgery.  Instead I chose to celebrate my weight loss by having an amped up day.  I started by making a high-protein low calorie hot breakfast.   Barbara and I then went down to the gym for an amped up version of my normal workout.

A couple weeks ago I ordered a [Spanx for men compression T-shirt](http://www.freshpair.com/Spanx-for-Men-Cotton-Compression-Crew-607.html).  I ordered this not to make me look thinner, but because as I have lost those 195 pounds I now have a lot of loose hanging skin in my abdomen.  This skin makes vigorous cardio very difficult as with every step it flaps and smacks against the rest of my skin.  When I have tried in the last couple years to jog or run, this has become very painful very quickly and has prevented me from doing anything vigorous.  Today, wearing my Spanx I was able to get up to 6 miles per hour and maintain that for several minutes.  I did the rest of my 30 minutes on the treadmill at a still brisk 3.8 miles per hour.  I then followed up with 25 minutes of strength training doing more sets at higher weights than I&#8217;ve done in the past.  I&#8217;m very proud of what I was able to do today and I intend on spending the next several months continuing to amp up my workouts.

I have a goal now of getting to the point where I can run a 5K, hopefully within the next year.  My hope is to do one of [RunDisney&#8217;s 5K runs](http://www.rundisney.com/) in 2014, and then start ramping up to bigger and better runs after that.

After going to a movie (where I drank water instead of anything caloric), I came home and made a delicious low calorie high-protein dream dinner to finish off the day and I&#8217;m not hungry and was quite satisfied with my meals today and my physical activity.

I did do one thing this evening as part of my celebration which is not best for my weight-loss.  I had a Piña Colada.  When going through the pre-op preparation I was told that I would have to stay away from Alcohol for a year.  Since that year ended yesterday I let myself have a single 6 ounce Piña Colada to celebrate.

I never was much of a drinker and I&#8217;m not going to become one now that I can drink again, but I will allow myself a drink here and there.

I&#8217;ll keep you all up to date with how things keep going as I continue my weight loss journey.
