Yesterday I [retweeted](http://twitter.com/NickMoline/status/1598161878) a [post by ReadWriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/geocities_closure_signals_end_of_an_era.php){.broken_link} concerning Yahoo&#8217;s announcement that they are [closing down GeoCities this year](http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/geocities/geocities-05.html).

This was particularly sad news for me because GeoCities was where my first website was hosted. Within a day of getting the internet at home for the first time (On December 26th, 1995) I signed up an account at GeoCities, which was at Area51/Labyrinth/1226 (it&#8217;s long since gone so there&#8217;s no point in me linking to it here), but that site eventually evolved into [The SubspaceLink](http://www.subspacelink.com/).

I had a great time on GeoCities back in the 90s, and even was a volunteer for them as part of their Community Leader program, and even had stock in the company (a measly 10 shares, but stock nonetheless).

In 1999, [Yahoo purchased GeoCities](http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-220817.html) for about $4.5 billion, and my 10 shares of GeoCities became 6 shares of Yahoo, their stock split twice since then (in 2000 and 2004), so now I have 24 shares of yahoo, which I <abbr style="border-bottom: dotted 1px" title="Of course I should have sold the 12 shares back in 2000 when it was going for $97 a share in March and got $1,164 instead of the $353.52 it's worth today">still hold today</abbr>.

Yahoo didn&#8217;t waste any time in terminating the Community Leader program (a decision I always thought was a bad one, as the since of community was what made GeoCities great).

Anyway, this is more rambly then most of my posts, so I&#8217;ll probably end up editing or deleting it later, but I wanted to do something fun. I just checked to make sure it&#8217;s true but my old geocities email address still works (after all these years), so drop me an email at it at <sttngfan@geocities.com> so I can enjoy it again just a little bit more before Geocities dies forever.
