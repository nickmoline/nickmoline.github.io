<p>And this is my first blog entry typed on my brand new laptop computer, I&#8217;ve been waiting for my own laptop for a long time and now I finally have one. As society gets faster and faster, mobility is a necessity in the computing world. Now that I have a laptop I can blog on the go, I may have to start frequenting coffee shops ðŸ™‚ or perhaps not.Anyway today was a highly productive day, I fixed most of a freeside installation, made some modifications to allow for more dynamic formatting of the invoices, repaired a computer, repaired an sql installation, and after I came home I started personalizing the new laptop that arrived fedex while I was at work and installing the programs I&#8217;ll need to do my job effectively.</p> 

<p>Not that much more going on and I have to get up early in the morning because I will have to take a trip out to Dallas to visit a client so I&#8217;ll end this log entry for now, talk to ya&#8217;ll again soon.</p>
