Well I&#8217;m changing blog systems to BLOG:CMS because Movable Type has gone commercial. I chose BLOG:CMS because it was based on Nucleus (which was open source (aka, non commercial) and has a nifty little importer feature where I can import all my blog entries from MovableType and thus.. not lose anything. BLOG:CMS was nice as well because it had a number of built in skins and templates and plugins, so without waiting for JMac to figure out how to port my beautiful old blog template over to a new one, I can at least have a somewhat functional skin right off the bat. There are also a number of nifty addins that BLOG:CMS has by default that would be difficult in MovableType.

In the expanded version of this post you will see the shameless plug by the authors of BLOG:CMS for the software as well as a feature list.Thank you ðŸ™‚
