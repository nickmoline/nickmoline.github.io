Well I spent the week helping out at _&#8220;SonGames 2004&#8221;_, this year&#8217;s VBS at ERCC.

It&#8217;s been a fun week but I&#8217;m exhausted. A Whole week of going to church at 8:30 in the morning (including last Sunday where I went at 8 cause I was running powerpoint) when I&#8217;ve been getting used to not having anywhere to go in the morning was taking it&#8217;s toll on me. Plus there was always something I needed to do in the afternoons and evenings too so I was getting home at like 9 p.m. every night and was so exhausted I wanted to go straight to sleep. Tonight I&#8217;m going to try and get the Death Star (The <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.gxps.net/">GOC</span> gaming server) on-line.

<span class="removed_link" title="http://blog.fchat.org/">Goo</span> is rather ticked at me lately since I was going to try and get this thing online over a week ago but haven&#8217;t even plugged it in yet.
