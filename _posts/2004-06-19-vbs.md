Well I spent the week helping out at _"SonGames 2004"_, this year's VBS at ERCC.

<!--more-->

It's been a fun week but I'm exhausted. A Whole week of going to church at 8:30 in the morning (including last Sunday where I went at 8 cause I was running powerpoint) when I've been getting used to not having anywhere to go in the morning was taking it's toll on me. Plus there was always something I needed to do in the afternoons and evenings too so I was getting home at like 9 p.m. every night and was so exhausted I wanted to go straight to sleep. Tonight I'm going to try and get the Death Star (The GOC gaming server) on-line.

Goo is rather ticked at me lately since I was going to try and get this thing online over a week ago but haven't even plugged it in yet.
