Throughout the year there are a number of &#8220;Awareness Months&#8221; for various diseases and disorders, and while I sympathize with people with these disorders, and have a tendency to donate to their various goals, most awareness months have little personal effect on me. October however is different, in that I have a personal reason to support [Lupus Awareness Month](http://www.livingwithlupusblog.com/2008/10/october-is-lupus-awareness-month/){.broken_link}

I have not posted here in my blog about this before, but most of you who know me personally are aware that my Wife has battled with the horrible auto-immune disease known as Lupus. When she was 12, it nearly killed her, and I would never have known the woman who is the Love of my Life.

[<img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.nick.pro/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/m-o-300x156.png?resize=300%2C156&#038;ssl=1" title="M-O" alt="M-O" width="300" height="156" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-252" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://adisney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/wall-e/)Lupus is an auto-immune disease, which in layman&#8217;s terms is like the opposite of AIDS, instead of having no immune system, people like my wife have an over-active immune system. Their immune system is so vigilant in it&#8217;s destruction of things that it determines is a &#8220;foreign contaminant&#8221;, that it gets confused, and starts attacking tissues in the body as well. The end result is that the white blood cells literally destroy the body from the inside out.

There is no cure for Lupus, and it kills, and funds for research are desperately needed in the search for a cure. So please, check out [The Lupus Foundation of America](http://www.lupus.org/) or [the Alliance for Lupus Research](http://www.lupusresearch.org/) and learn how you can make a difference in the research of this deadly disease.

If you want to know more about Lupus, I recommend you check out the [Living with Lupus Blog](http://www.livingwithlupusblog.com/){.broken_link}, written by my wife, Barbara Moline, or visit [lupus.org](http://www.lupus.org/) or [lupusresearch.org](http://www.lupusresearch.org/)
