I&#8217;ve updated Cap&#8217;s Log to the new WordPress 2.1, though this may only be temporary, I&#8217;m planning on combining it and several other blogs I manage into a WordPress MU installation once I&#8217;m sure that MU works. In other news, after listening to this week&#8217;s episode of MacBreak Weekly, I&#8217;ve started messing around with Twitter. I installed a wordpress plugin that should automatically update my Twitter page whenever I&#8217;m working on a Blog post, which is in a way a bit frightening, cause that means that you all can now know when I&#8217;m blogging.Â  Also, it was noted to me recently that my title tags were broken on all my posts, I have repaired this now, and so my title tags should indicate what post you are actually reading.
