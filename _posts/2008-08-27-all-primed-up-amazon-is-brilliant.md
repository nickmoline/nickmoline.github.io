I&#8217;ve been a member of [Amazon Prime](http://www.amazon.com/gp/subs/primeclub/signup/extmain.html?
ref=prime_assoc_bt&tag=nickdotpro-20) for over about 2 years now, and I was just thinking today what brilliant marketing it is. By paying a nominal yearly fee, I get free two day shipping, or really cheap next day shipping on everything I buy from them, but does it save me any money? See before I was an Amazon Prime member, I used to make sure that my Amazon orders reached the $25 minimum to get free &#8220;Super Saver Shipping&#8221; so I didn&#8217;t pay for shipping in the first place.

However now that I&#8217;m an Amazon Prime member, I find myself buying things on Amazon I would normally have gone to a store and spending not only my time, which is getting less and less, but in many cases more money. Now when I need to buy something, I find myself saying &#8220;Let me check to see if Amazon has it&#8221;, and if it does for the same or less price, I buy it there. What&#8217;s amazing is, a lot of the time, Amazon has it cheaper.

I&#8217;ve got to hand it to Amazon, by coming up with a system that gives people faster shipping, they&#8217;ve got me looking to them first, instead of last for the things I need.

If you haven&#8217;t tried out Amazon Prime, [Check out their free trial](http://www.amazon.com/gp/subs/primeclub/signup/extmain.html?
