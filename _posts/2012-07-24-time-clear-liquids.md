[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-806" title="31965874" alt="31965874" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.nick.pro/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/31965874-199x300.jpg?resize=199%2C300&#038;ssl=1" width="199" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" />](https://i2.wp.com/www.nick.pro/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/31965874.jpg?ssl=1)This morning at 10 am Pacific time marked 48 hours till I go under the knife.  That means it is officially time to switch to clear liquids only.  On the bright side, no more protein shakes until a few days after surgery.  On the not so bright side, I&#8217;m now severely limiting my caloric intake even more.

I had my monthly normal weigh in this afternoon and was down only slightly from my pre-op appointment with my surgeon from a couple weeks ago.  I&#8217;m now down to **404.0 lbs** which brings my total weight loss down to **86.2 pounds**.

For those of my friends and family who believe in the power of prayer, please pray for me as I go through this final diet step before surgery, and on Thursday at 10 am Pacific time, when the operation will begin.

_Note for those confused why losing 2.7 more pounds only brings me to 86.2 pounds when I had [previously stated](https://www.nick.pro/2012/07/10/pre-op-appointment-day-down-86-pounds/ "Pre-Op Appointment Day, Down over 83 pounds!") I had lost 86.1 pounds. I apparently was mistaken [when I wrote that my initial weigh in number was 492.8 pounds](https://www.nick.pro/2012/06/01/weight-loss-update-and-transparency/ "Weight Loss Update and transparency") back in January, 2011.  My initial weigh in was actually 490.2 pounds.  I have adjusted the numbers from my previous 2 posts accordingly to indicate that at my previous post the number should have been 83.5 pounds._
