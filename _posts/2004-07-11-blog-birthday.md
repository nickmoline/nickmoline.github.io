Today marks the 1 year anniversary of the day I started my blog last year, happy Birthday blog!

Also, 5 days ago was the 1 year anniversary of the day I started writing my first story, Miles Apart over on fanfiction.net. Some of you know that I am currently working on writing my first two novels. Unlike that original story, these are not fanfictions but instead are stories set with my own characters in my own situations. I&#8217;m looking forward to finishing them.
