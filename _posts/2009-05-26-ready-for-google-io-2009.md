My wife and are are checked into our hotel in San Francisco. Tomorrow begins [Google I/O 2009](http://code.google.com/io){.broken_link} at the Moscone Center West in San Francisco. I&#8217;m quite looking forward to two days of Google Developer Goodness. I&#8217;m hoping that we&#8217;ll learn about a lot of great new updates to Google APIs and developer tools, and of course, I haven&#8217;t forgot about my prediction that [Google Chrome will get Extensions at Google I/O](https://www.nick.pro/2009/02/04/google-chrome-extensions-coming-out-by-may/). I&#8217;m a little more cautious about saying that for sure, but I&#8217;m still pretty optimistic that it will happen, or at least we&#8217;ll get some sort of time table as to when we will.

After all [Developing Extensions for Google Chrome](http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions/DevelopingExtensionsGoogleChrome.html){.broken_link} is still on the Agenda, in the very first timeslot of the conference (after the Keynote that is) in fact. I&#8217;m expecting to get a formal announcement about Extensions either during the Keynote itself, or at least during that particular session.  But we&#8217;ll find out if I&#8217;m right tomorrow.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll find time to write up some notes I took from the Conference over the next couple of days, but if it is anything like last year, time will be short indeed.

On a related matter, if any of my readers are here at Google I/O, leave me a comment, or tweet to me <a href=&#8221;http://twitter.com/nickmoline&#8221;>@nickmoline</a>, I&#8217;m looking forward to meeting with fellow developers during the conference.
