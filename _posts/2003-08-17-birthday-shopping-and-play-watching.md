_::in best news voice::_ And this is Nick Moline with the weekend report _::end news voice::_

Yesterday was interesting, mom threw a Jewelry party at the house so I sought the first excuse I could to get out of there, and that excuse ended up being helping my dad (who was also trying to escape the women buying jewelry) pick out my little brother's birthday present (his birthday is this coming Friday), on the off chance that he reads this or that one of his friends reads this and passes it on to him, I won't say anything further about gift shopping.

So I took a separate car then my dad so we took a slightly longer then normal time shopping for the gift then Dad went back to the party and I snuck off to the movies. On the risk of embarrassing myself I will tell you what movie I went and saw, _Freaky Friday_. Newsflash all, it's good, no really it is!

Yes it's a 3rd version of the same movie by the same movie studio (for those of you who don't know, there was a made for TV movie version of _Freaky Friday_ back in '95 in addition to the 70's original with Jodie Foster). I have to say this latest version with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohen is very good, perhaps better then the original.

Lindsay is very convincing as both the Teen and the adult in the teen body, Jamie is also convincing in both her roles and plays a hilarious teen trapped in a woman's body, however although it is a convincing teen, it's not very convincing that it is Anna (Lindsay's character at the beginning of the movie) trapped in Tess's body rather then some other teen, Lindsay is a bit more mellow in general then the &#8220;child version&#8221; of Curtis, but it was still hilarious, the only problem with the movie is I think they went over the top in Anna's love interest in the movie falling for Anna stuck in Tess's body, yes I know the point was to show that he liked Anna for her mind not her body, but yuck, it went a bit too far when he was singing &#8220;_Hit Me Baby One More Time_&#8221; outside Tess' window, talk about freaky.

Anyway after the party one of mom's friends was still hanging around the house for several hours, but one is manageable, 10 is not.

On to today&#8230;

I got up early to go to church, Mr. E the head of the audio visual team had told me earlier that I would be put in a rotational schedule and not be needed every week but he hadn't yet told me what that schedule was so I decided to come anyway just in case it was my week, turns out it was not, next week is. So I still went to both services anyway, was actually kinda cool, in the first service I was asked to help collect the offering for the first time in the 4 and a half years I've gone to this church. In the 2nd service I sat with my family for the first time in a long time, well most of my family, David sat with the youth group, but it was nice to sit with my parents for once.

After church and a brief lunch the four of us went to see a play at Theater Arlington, that was fun, it is the second time I've been there, the first time was for a presentation of _It's a Wonderful Life_ back in December, today's presentation was called _Communicating Doors_ and dealt with time travel, it was quite good, I won't discuss the plot here cause it would take too long, but I found it quite interesting and entertaining, a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

Overall it was a nice weekend, but in the morning it is back to the grindstone, how fun! _TTFN_!
