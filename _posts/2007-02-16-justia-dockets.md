I&#8217;m really excited about a new project I have been working on for my job. [Justia Federal District Court Filings and Dockets](http://dockets.justia.com/) is a new project I have had the pleasure of working on for Justia (the company I work for). This project is a database of all of the civil cases filed in federal district courts since the beginning of 2006, updated daily, and what&#8217;s truly great about it is that you can get RSS feeds of various methods of filtering the database. You can filter it by category, state, individual court, party name, or any combination of those filters, and then subscribe to an RSS feed for your filtered results.

<!--more-->

For example you can get a listing of all cases filed by or against [Apple](http://dockets.justia.com/search?query=Apple+Inc.&search=Search&stateorcourt=&lawsuittype=&min-day=1&min-month=1&min-year=2006&max-day=15&max-month=2&max-year=2007) to track everyone who is suing them over the iPhone, then when you find a particular case you want more information about (like the [Cisco Systems, Inc. v. Apple Inc.](http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-candce/case_no-3:2007cv00198/case_id-187974/) case of January 10th, 2007 (lawsuit over the trademark on the name iPhone), you can pull up a page with [information](http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-candce/case_no-3:2007cv00198/case_id-187974/) about the case, including quick search links to search for the parties in a variety of different search engines, and a link to download all the case dockets on PACER (PACER is a service of the us courts system, and charges $0.08 per page). More interesting features are coming soon on Justia Federal District Court Filings and Dockets, but the project is yet another amazing free legal resource that I&#8217;ve worked on in my time here at Justia.

I may be a bit biased as far as my affinity for the project, considering how hard I worked on it, but I&#8217;m not the only one who is excited about it. [Try searching blawgsearch for &#8220;justia dockets&#8221;](http://blawgsearch.justia.com/search.aspx?query=justia+dockets "Justia BlawgSearch: Search Results for Justia Dockets") to see just how many people are praising this fine new service of Justia.

Stay tuned next week for an announcement of yet another really cool project I&#8217;ve been working on with them.

In other news, as I want to push this site further toward some of the things I am doing professionally, you can now access this site at [nick.pro](https://www.nick.pro/). I may redesign the site layout to fit more in this new scheme, or I may not, but for now it&#8217;s cool to know that my blog is available at [www.nick.pro](https://www.nick.pro/) (_special thanks to my boss for arranging this new highly professional domain name for me_).
