Tonight we had a visitor from Germany. Frank Liesen, was youth pastor of my church when I first moved here to Texas. He left when he felt called to Germany where he&#8217;s lived for the last 5 years is in town on Furlough. He and his wife and new baby came over to visit with us for dinner. I took this picture of him with my cell phone to illustrate the blog. Not a very clear picture, but I took it in a hurry.
