I&#8217;ve blogged from my iPhone before so this isn&#8217;t exactly new, but this post was written using the new WordPress iPhone native app just released in the app store today. I like it!

As an update I still haven&#8217;t acquired a new iPhone 3G, but JMac seems to have finally <span class="removed_link" title="http://blog.jmaclabs.com/2008/07/22/iphone-arrives/">joined the iPhone revolution</span> and now has one. Welcome to the club JM, I&#8217;m very jealous that you got a 3G before me.
