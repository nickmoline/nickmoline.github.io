WizardCast Episode 3 is out, including some interesting announcements. I&#8217;ll go ahead an innumerate the announcements here, though I haven&#8217;t yet on the WizardCast website. First, we&#8217;ve expaned WizardCast into [Wizards.FM, the Wizard&#8217;s Webcast Network](http://www.wizards.fm/) and have already recorded a few additional shows that will be coming out in addition to WizardCast, including &#8220;_The Looking Glass_&#8221; a movie review podcast where we review the latest in Fantasy and Science Fiction movies, &#8220;_WizFM News_&#8221; where we take our news segment out of WizardCast and produce it more regularly, &#8220;_The Witching Hour_&#8221; where we introduce people to fantasy and science fiction music, particularly Wizard Rock bands, and &#8220;_The Common Room Fire_&#8221; where we review Science Fiction and Fantasy Books.

The second, even bigger announcement is that this summer, we will be doing a Live Podcast at the Book&#8217;s Inc Laurel Village, in San Francisco the night of the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It will be tons of fun with giveaways, contests, trivia, and much more.
