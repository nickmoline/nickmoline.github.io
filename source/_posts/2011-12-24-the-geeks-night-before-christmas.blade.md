Last night I was trying to think about where to put my stocking, and when it dawned on me to put it on the shelf above the TV, it inspired me to write this parody.  I hope you enjoy it.

> Twas the Night before Christmas, and in the Geek&#8217;s House  
> The only thing stirring was the Geek&#8217;s mouse
>
> The stocking was hung by the Plasma with care,  
> In hopes that [UPS](http://www.ups.com/) soon would be there;
> 
> He was busy coding, no time for bed  
> Visions of source code, danced through his head
> 
> Wearing a ThinkGeek t-shirt, and a Tux cap,  
> He [tracked Santa Claus](http://www.noradsanta.org/) on the Google Earth App
> 
> When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,  
> He clicked straight to [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) to research the matter.
> 
> News site and blog he clicked like a flash,  
> When nothing he found, to the front door he dashed.
> 
> When, what to his wondering eyes should appear  
> but a big brown truck, it was finally here!  
> 
> With a little old driver, so lively and quick,  
> A UPS man, did you think St. Nick?
> 
> More rapid than eagles, his charges they came,  
> The Geek whistled, and shouted, and called them by name
> 
> From [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/?&tag=capslog-20&camp=211493&creative=379973&linkCode=ez&adid=1PRSNK7GXJ04D1CX9FWZ&), [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/), [ThinkGeek](http://www.thinkgeek.com/) and [Zappos](http://www.zappos.com/),  
> Great gifts bought online, he wondered who sent those.
> 
> The man brought them out and stacked them up high  
> So many presents, they reached to the sky.
> 
> He had a broad face, and a little round belly  
> That shook when he laugh&#8217;d, like a bowl full of jelly
> 
> When finally done with stacking straight as a line  
> he brought out a clipboard and pen and said, &#8220;Sign&#8221;
> 
> Then placing one finger aside of his nose,  
> The man gave a nod and into the truck he rose
> 
> He turned his key, and drove down the lane  
> The geek looked down at brown packages plain
> 
> He opened the first, and smiled when inside  
> An iPod from his mother, wrapping paper did hide
> 
> The second he found, was a Blu-Ray from a friend  
> Such generosity, his heart it did mend
> 
> Boxes and boxes, each one he did ope&#8217;.  
> Each tech gift filled him with joy and hope
> 
> My story is done, to me it did Psych  
> A Geeky Christmas to all, if you enjoyed it click <amp-facebook-like width="90" height="20" layout="fixed" data-layout="button_count" data-href="{{ $page->postUrl("2011-12-24-the-geeks-night-before-christmas") }}"></amp-facebook-like>

_My Makeshift Mantle that inspired this poem, technically speaking this is an LCD TV, not a Plasma TV, but Plasma flowed better_
