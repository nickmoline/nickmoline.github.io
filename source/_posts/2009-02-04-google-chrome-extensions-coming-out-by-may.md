That&#8217;s right, I said it, and so far I&#8217;m the only one who has. Google [has announced](http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10110247-2.html) that extensions are coming to Google Chrome but have been mum on when. However I saw something today, that indicates the timetable may be short. Google officially [opened up registration](http://code.google.com/events/io/) for Google I/O 2009, their third annual (first one was just called Google Developer Day) Developer&#8217;s Conference.

Like last year, it will take place at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Along with the open pre-registration, they&#8217;ve also posted a [list of Sessions](http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html){.broken_link} (subject to change). High up on the list is a session entitled &#8220;**Developing extensions for Google Chrome**&#8221; which contains the following description:

> Learn how Google Chrome makes it easy to write extensions using the web technologies you already know. This talk will cover the basics of the extension system (distribution/packaging, installation, updates), as well as the different APIs to enhance with the browser.

I&#8217;d say this is a safe bet that if Extensions are not released BEFORE Google I/O, then they will be released as a new feature AT Google I/O. Extensions are coming, but what about Mac Support?

**UPDATE FROM GOOGLE I/O:** While the session went through as planned, it turns out [my theory was wrong]({{ $page->postLink("2009-05-27-i-was-wrong-turns-out-chrome-extensions-arent-ready-yet") }}), they simply aren&#8217;t ready to announce support for extensions yet, although it is coming soon, and they are really well implemented in beta.

**UPDATE 2 (June 3rd):** The Session video is now up on youtube, I&#8217;ve embedded it below:
