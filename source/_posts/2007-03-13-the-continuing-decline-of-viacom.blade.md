I&#8217;ve long been disillusioned with Viacom and it&#8217;s child companies, especially after CBS/UPN canceled such great shows as Enterprise and Joan of Arcadia, despite massive Fan support. Today, Viacom proves yet again that it doesn&#8217;t care about the interest of it&#8217;s viewers, [Viacom has filed a lawsuit](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/viacom-sues-youtube-google-for-1b/) against Google for $1 billion dollars.

The story goes, that according to Viacom, over a hundred thousand Viacom copyrighted materials have been viewed on Google owned YouTube over a million and a half times. The problem with Viacom&#8217;s claim though is that they believe it is Google&#8217;s fault for allowing the clips to be uploaded in the first place. YouTube wouldn&#8217;t work if it weren&#8217;t for allowing clips to be uploaded, and YouTube has long had a [mechanism in place](http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=58127) where if a copyright owner complains, they will pull down the copyrighted content quickly.

I decided to look up the lawsuit to see the information on this suit is available. I did a [Search for Viacom](https://dockets.justia.com/search?query=Viacom) on [Justia Federal Court Filings and Dockets](https://dockets.justia.com/), and found [Viacom International, Inc. et al v. Youtube, Inc. et al](https://dockets.justia.com/docket/new-york/nysdce/1:2007cv02103/302164), case 1:2007cv02103, filed March 13th, 2007 in the New York Southern Federal District Court, Foley Square Office.
