I&#8217;m [all registered](http://twitter.com/NickMoline/status/179678092858630144) to go to Google I/O 2012 on June 27, 2012.  I&#8217;ve been to every Google I/O so far (and [Google Developer Day before that]({{ $page->postUrl("2007-06-03-google-developer-day-2007") }})) and am really looking forward to going again.  The price was really hiked up this year ($900 as opposed to $450 last year), but they have done away with the Early Registration discount, and they have extended the conference from 2 to 3 days this year.

The &#8220;real&#8221; price last year was $550 with an early-bird discount of $450, so when you consider there are no early birds this year, the increase is 38.9% for 50% more conference, so perhaps the increase isn&#8217;t so bad.
