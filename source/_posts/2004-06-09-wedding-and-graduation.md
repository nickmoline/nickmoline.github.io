The next couple days after my vacation were over were jam packed.

<!--more-->

First, on Saturday (May 28th), a couple good friends of mine, Pedro Cortez and Crystal Cooper, were married. My brother David was one of Pedro's groomsman. It was a beautiful ceremony, and I am very happy for them.

The next day, Sunday (May 29th), my brother graduated High School&#8230; No, I'm not joking, David graduated High School, so anyone who knows my mother should tease her that there are no longer any school aged children in the house. I have put up a number of pictures of Davids graduation in my Gallery. I really need a better camera&#8230;.

The following week was eventful, I went over to the District office a few times to get some work done.

I was unfortunately unable to talk to my girlfriend for the first few days of the week because she was on vacation in Gattlingburg. I wouldn't have been able to talk to her at all that week except that a few days into it, her teeth really started hurting her, so her family had to go home early. I&#8217;ve been praying for her teeth ever since.

Thursday I had a double feature day. It had been the first time I had gone to see a movie since the _Passion of the Christ_, so I was very eager to see a movie again. I had already bought my ticket to go see _Harry Potter: and the Prisoner of Azkaban_ at 12:01 a.m. (yes that&#8217;s right, I went to go see a kids movie at midnight on the first showing, I like Harry Potter OK?) but earlier in the day David really wanted to go see a movie, so we went to see Shrek 2. Both movies were excellent and I greatly enjoyed them.

My girlfriend went to the dentist yesterday to see about her teeth and they told her that she was going to need to see a specialist, so she&#8217;s worried about the cost of that.

Yesterday I began a process I like to call **The Big Clean &#8211; June 2004**. My room has been a mess, so it&#8217;s high time I start trying to get it clean. To get an idea how bad it was, I&#8217;ve taken several &#8220;before&#8221; pictures which can be seen in my gallery.

So I&#8217;ve taken a bit of a break from that to write these back blog entries.

Also yesterday I had a interview for an Executive Officer position in ACTD, that was interesting, I hope I get it. I created this character back in 1998, and it would sure be nice for him to finally be able to have some command experience. There have been people I&#8217;ve known who joined ACTD after I did but are SM (Ship Managers) while my character is still a Lieutenant.

Anyway, back to **The Big Clean June 2004**&#8230;.
