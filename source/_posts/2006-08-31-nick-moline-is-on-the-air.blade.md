When I [first started this blog](https://www.nick.pro/2003/07/11/pop-into-internet-pop-culture/) just over 3 years ago (July, 2003) it was my second jaunt into internet pop culture. My foray into the culture of the web (after years of being a sort of web recluse) was to write a fanfic, then I created a blog, and now, now after these 3 years, I have published my first podcast episode. [WizardCast](http://wizardcast.wizards.pro/) is a Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Role Playing podcast by the staff of Wizards.Pro and the [HogwartsLive RPG](http://www.hogwartslive.com/).

I host this show, along with my co-host Barbara (my lovely wife), [Mike](http://www.goosite.net/), and the founder of HogwartsLive and Wizards.pro, [Danilo](http://danilo.ariadoss.com/). We discuss the latest Science Fiction and Fantasy News, we talk about interesting things coming up on the HogwartsLive game and generally have a great time, so if you want to hear my first broadcast ever, click the play link above, or better yet, if you have [iTunes Subscribe!](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=187518511)

I&#8217;m very proud of my first ever podcast, and am looking forward to publishing additional episodes soon!
