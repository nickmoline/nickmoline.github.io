Ok, now that I&#8217;m using the `application/xhtml+xml` mime type instead of `text/html`, using a <a title="Get Firefox" target="_blank" href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox">real browser</a> shows you where you have improperly formatted W3C incompliant code on your pages. So I&#8217;ve gone through each and every blog entry and fixed the errors in my old badly formatted xhtml. I&#8217;ve also (while I was editing them) gone through the trouble of unlocking all the entries that had locked themselves in the transition from MT to BLOG:CMS. This means that all entries can now be karma voted, and all entries can now be commented on.

Also tonight I upgraded Lori&#8217;s blog to the same updated version of the software that I&#8217;m using.
