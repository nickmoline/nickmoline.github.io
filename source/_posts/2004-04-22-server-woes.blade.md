Well I [previously posted]({{ $page->postLink("2004-04-22-week-from-hell") }}) today a number of things that were wrong with the week, now I&#8217;ve got some more. It turns out the hosting provider, fastservers.net, that hosts the server I&#8217;m sharing with some other companies, is nearly doubling their prices effective next month. So now we&#8217;ve got to get a new server set up somewhere else, transfer all the files, and then close down the old one because otherwise we are going to have downtime. In addition I am being sent a server from another company to get a second server set up and I haven&#8217;t the foggiest idea where I&#8217;m going to send this server that will be cost effective hosting for it. Also, one of my plug-ins (GeoSketch) for this blog seems to be malfunctioning because I had a nifty animated map that zoomed into Broken Bow, Oklahoma in my [last post]({{ $page->postLink("2004-04-22-week-from-hell") }}) that for whatever reason will simply not display, it displays the code instead, so I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s up with that, I removed the map from the entry from now after trying 3 times to get the map to show to no avail&#8230;. It&#8217;s just not my week, heck it&#8217;s not my month, my season, or my year.
