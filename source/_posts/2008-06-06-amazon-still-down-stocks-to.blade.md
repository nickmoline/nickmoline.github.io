[I previously reported](https://www.nick.pro/2008/06/06/amazon-down-but-not-out/) that Amazon.com was down with a non-descriptive error message. After almost 2 of downtime it seems they&#8217;ve decided to have a [friendlier error message](https://www.nick.pro/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/region-capture-7.png), so it seems at least they are acknowledging that something is wrong now, but it is still down. According to CNet, this outage could be [costing Amazon as much as $31,000 every minute!](http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9962010-7.html){.broken_link} This accounts to about $3,348,000 so far, and there&#8217;s no sign of the outage ending&#8230;

This is already hitting Amazon where it really hurts, [AMZN is down over 4% today](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:AMZN)
