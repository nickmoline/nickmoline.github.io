## Happy Binary Day!

So in addition to being [Veteran&#8217;s Day]({{ $page->postLink("2011-11-11-thank-you-veterans") }} "Thank you Veterans"), today, November 11, 2011, happens to be the last &#8220;Binary Day&#8221; I am ever likely to live through.  There have been 36 so-called &#8220;Binary Days&#8221; in the last 11 years (9 each in 2000, 2001, 2010 and 2011), where all the days of the date (except the century) consist of only the digits 0 and 1.  As a computer programmer, I can&#8217;t help but be tickled by days that appear to be in binary.

Today however, the 6 digit binary calendar hits its max at 11/11/11 and so there will not be another binary day (at all) until January 1, 2100 _(which could be represented as 01/01/100 for that extra binary digit goodness)_.  As this is over 88 years away, if I manage to live to it, I will be 117 years old, which isn&#8217;t very likely.

I say that makes this day worth remembering.  Some are calling it #NerdNewYear (the hash tag makes it extra nerdy), in Redwood City, there&#8217;s a [big block party](http://nerdnewyear.com/) currently counting down the seconds till 11/11/11 11:11:11 pm.  Unfortunately I couldn&#8217;t make it to the party tonight, but I wish all my fellow Hackers and other Nerds a great time at the party.

Happy Binary Day Everyone, Enjoy it, it will probably be your last.
