I had a hard time sleeping last night. A Storm was raging all night long and when I wasn&#8217;t being woken up by the extremely loud thunder and hard rain, I was being woken up by horrible nightmares

I dreamed I was being dangled above the water. I wasn&#8217;t hung in a noose or anything like that but my feet were dangling below me, I was in some sort of harness around my waist. Below me an Aligator (or Crocodile no idea really, can&#8217;t remember how to tell them apart) was leaping out of the water and snapping at my legs trying to eat me. I was kicking the aligator trying to stop it, but it was just a matter of time. I was woken when a bite hit home and the beast chomped down on my legs.

Because of this I had a rather poor night&#8217;s sleep and ended up sleeping in when it finally stopped, I think I finally settled down to a stable sleep about 9:30 and woke again at 1.
