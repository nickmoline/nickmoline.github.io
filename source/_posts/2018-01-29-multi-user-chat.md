In the [second post](https://onward.justia.com/2018/01/29/collaborative-law-firm-part-ii-multi-user-chat/) in the [Collaborative Law Firm Series](https://onward.justia.com/tag/the-collaborative-law-firm/) of posts over on Justia's Legal Marketing & Technology Blog, I expand on the [previous topic](https://onward.justia.com/2017/07/28/collaborative-law-firm-instant-messaging/) of instant messaging services to focus on services for chatting with groups of people at once.

In this article I review Slack, Stride/HipChat, Flock, and Chanty.  I also discuss using your existing Instant Messaging services as a multi-user chat with Google Hangouts Chat and Skype for Business.  And finally, as before I give you a self-hosted option by talking about running your own Internet Relay Chat (IRC) service on a local server.

Check out [the article](https://onward.justia.com/2018/01/29/collaborative-law-firm-part-ii-multi-user-chat/) for my findings.
