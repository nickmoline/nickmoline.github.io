Today, August 10th, is my 35th birthday.  I have to say this is the first birthday where I&#8217;ve actually felt &#8220;old.&#8221;  I realize the many friends I have who are older than me probably think that is silly, but to me this seems like a real benchmark year.  It makes me feel like I should come up with some numbers to quantify my life.  Note I&#8217;m sticking to things that have numbers here, not listing specific life events unless it is to count them.

## Where I&#8217;ve Lived my Life

Of the **12,785 days** I&#8217;ve been alive, I&#8217;ve lived in the following states:

<table class="wp-block-table">
    <tr>
        <td>California<sup>*</sup></td>
        <td><strong>7,484</strong> days</td>
        <td>58.537%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Texas<sup>*</sup></td>
        <td><strong>2,967</strong> days</td>
        <td>23.207%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Florida<sup>*</sup></td>
        <td><strong>182</strong> days</td>
        <td>1.423%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Virginia</td>
        <td><strong>1,957</strong> days</td>
        <td>15.307%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>North Carolina</td>
        <td><strong>194</strong> days</td>
        <td>1.517%</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<small><em><sup>*</sup> Note, when I was very young I spent 6 months each in Texas and Florida.  Since I do not have the precise move in and out days for those locations, I&#8217;m estimating under the assumption that I spent half a year in each location (182 days, giving the extra 1 day back to California).  I likely did not spend exactly 182 days in each of Florida and Texas, so the exact number of days for California, Texas and Florida may be slightly off.</em></small>

By far the longest of these locations is California at 58% of my life, or just under **20 and a half years**, followed by Texas at 23% of my life (**8.1 years**).  If you instead split this up into individual segments of time I&#8217;ve lived in individual places, California still wins with this most recent move to California I&#8217;ve been here **3,949 days** so far which is more than the total of all of the time spent in Texas across the **3 times** I lived there.

## What I&#8217;ve Done **with** My Life

**3,948** of those days I&#8217;ve been employed at Justia meaning I&#8217;ve worked for Justia for **30.88%** of my life.  Prior to that, I worked a variety of jobs for a number of companies, including a stint trying to run my own hosting company for a while.

Slightly longer than I&#8217;ve worked for Justia, **4,058 days** or **31.740%** of my life, I&#8217;ve been married to my wife Barbara and she has made my life richer and filled it with love these **11 years, 1 month, and 8 days**.

## What I&#8217;ve Done **in** My Life

In these 35 years, I&#8217;ve gotten to do or be a part of a lot of great things.  I&#8217;ve acted in **2** plays, while working tech for **5** more, and I have at least **2** more planned soon (_Fiddler on the Roof_ is in rehearsals right now and I&#8217;ll be working sound for it, as well as _Avenue Q_ after that).

I&#8217;ve gotten to attend **2** Stanley Cup final games (once in Chicago, once here in San Jose), **2** World Series Games (both in San Francisco), and a number of playoff games for both the _San Francisco Giants_ and the _San Jose Sharks,_ as well as too many other great non-playoff games to count.

I&#8217;ve gotten to see **12** Broadway musical professional performances (**4** in San Francisco, **2** in San Jose, **3** on Broadway in New York, **2** in Las Vegas, and **1** in Chicago).  I already have my tickets purchased to see another professional production in November (_Aladdin_), which will bring the professional production count up to **13**, as well as bumping the San Francisco number to **5**.  _Note that **3** of those performances were separate performances of the same play (Wicked), so I&#8217;ve only seen professional performances of **10** distinct musicals._

## What has Happened in My Lifetime

There have been **6** US Presidents in my lifetime (Reagan started his first term the year before I was born), **194** of the [top 200 movies by domestic box office](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic.htm) have been released in my lifetime (_E.T._, the number 15 on the list, came out 2 months before I was born).  If you [adjust for inflation](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm), this number goes down to **124**.

## Other Random Numbers

According to the [You&#8217;re Getting Old](http://you.regettingold.com/10/08/1982/Tmljaw/) site, I&#8217;ve had a total of **630** candles on birthday cakes (assuming I always got a cake with individual year candles on it, which I didn&#8217;t), the moon has orbited the earth **468** times since I was born, and the population of Earth increased **60.357%** from **4,662,143,140** to over **7,476,065,380**.

The Featured photo for this post was one of the birthday desserts Disneyland gave me while I was there celebrating last week.  This chocolate mousse was incredibly delicious and it was super cute too.  The dessert itself comes with the _Fantasmic_ Dining Package at the Blue Bayou.  The meal was delicious and the reserved viewing area for people who ate at the Blue Bayou had a fantastic vantage point to watch the newly revamped _Fantasmic_ show.
