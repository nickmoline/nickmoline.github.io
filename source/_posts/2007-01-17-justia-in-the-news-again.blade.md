I [previously mentioned]({{ $page->postUrl("2006-12-19-california-here-i-come") }} "Life Changes") a project I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to work on at my new job known as [BlawgSearch](http://www.blawgsearch.com/ "Justia's BlawgSearch.com"), a search engine for legal blogs. Today BusinessWire contains a [press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070117005639/en/Justia-Releases-BlawgSearch.com-Legal-Blog-Legal-Podcast) Officially announcing BlawgSearch to the world. BlawgSearch is by far one of the most advanced bits of coding I&#8217;ve ever had the privilege of working on and I&#8217;m very pleased to have been a part of it.
