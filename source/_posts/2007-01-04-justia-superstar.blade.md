I [previously mentioned](/2006/12/19/california-here-i-come/ "Life Changes") that I was sitting on something very cool with my new job, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.justia.com/">Justia</a>. I did not want to mention it in my blog before they had a chance to release a press release on this announcement. Google has named Justia an Enterprise Search Superstar for it&#8217;s use of the Google mini to index Supreme Court decisions and other legal content.

> _&#8220;Google customers continue to demonstrate in new and innovative ways how search can improve a business,&#8221; said Matthew Glotzbach, head of products for Google Enterprise. &#8220;Google is happy to honor Justia as a Google Search Superstar, and a terrific example of excellence in search.&#8221;_
