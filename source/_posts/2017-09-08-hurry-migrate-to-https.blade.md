My latest post on Justia's Blog reiterates the impending deadline for [migrating your site to HTTPS](https://onward.justia.com/2017/09/08/hurry-time-running-migrate-site-https/).  If you haven't migrated your site to HTTPS yet, you need to get right on that.  

Check out [my article](https://onward.justia.com/2017/09/08/hurry-time-running-migrate-site-https/) for more on why it is important to migrate your site right away, and check out [my previous article](https://onward.justia.com/2017/04/03/https-is-still-hard-but-necessary-for-your-success/) on the subject which includes describing the pitfalls you'll run into when trying to migrate your site to HTTPS.
