So I upgraded to the 2.1 software this morning on my iPhone. There aren&#8217;t any new features, but the array of fixes that [Apple promises](http://www.tuaw.com/2008/09/12/iphone-2-1-firmware-out-now/) with the new update are much needed, if it turns out to work.

<!--more-->

* Increased Call Stability
* Better Battery Life
* Faster Backups
* Faster interface

I&#8217;m reserving overall judgment, but so far it seems to be working just like Apple said it would.

* I [turned backup back on](http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/05/iphone-101-speedier-iphone-backups-three-ways/) and the backup part of iTunes sync was done in about 5 seconds, as opposed to the HOUR or more that I&#8217;ve experienced before.
* Since getting everything synced the way I want it, I&#8217;ve had it unplugged for several hours with both 3G and Wi-Fi on, as well as periodic checking of email, and my battery gauge still shows full.
* The opening and closing of applications, particularly the contact list on the Phone app seems much snappier.

I&#8217;ll let you know later on if it really has made an impact on the few negatives that were remaining on the iPhone 3G, but in the mean time, how about some news from the other side of the fence. Microsoft has released their second Seinfeld & Bill Gates commercial, and while it&#8217;s not going to make me switch back to Windoze, I have to admit, it made me chuckle a little bit.
