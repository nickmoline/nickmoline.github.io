[Long ago](https://www.nick.pro/2004/04/11/updated-map/) I used to update a World66 Map any time I had been somewhere I hadn&#8217;t been before, well since then I have been to 2 other states. The reason I think about this now is because I returned to those states a week ago to see my sister get married.
