Well depending on how you look at it, either yesterday or today is the 10 day mark from when &#8220;[the letter]({{ $page->postLink("2004-12-09-and-two-of-those-mudflaps") }})&#8221; was written, and so far the police have not stormed down the door and taken me off in cuffs. On the other hand, I have not received word that they believe me from the DA&#8217;s office yet either. They did receive my letter. I sent it certified mail and they received it on Tuesday according to the USPS, but no word back from them in any form that they believe my story, and no word that they are after the real culprits of this crime. I guess now all I can do is wait.
