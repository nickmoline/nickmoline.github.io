In the latest in my ongoing series of Major websites experiencing outages, [GMail](http://www.gmail.com/) has been down for at least the last hour. Google&#8217;s Mail service is excellent and over all I&#8217;ve always been pleased with it. Their servers are redundant, I don&#8217;t have problems with lost email messages, and the spam filtering is second to none. I also am a big fan of the search, filtering, and conversation features that make it the best email experience I&#8217;ve ever had, but today, it&#8217;s down, and I can&#8217;t access my email, which again slows down my productivity. But I take it as a bit of comfort, because the next time one of my sites goes down I&#8217;ll remember, even Google has server outages sometimes.

It&#8217;s important to note that while the web interface (which I primarily use) is down, the IMAP appears to be fully operational, so I&#8217;m still getting new emails buzzing on my iPhone constantly, I just much prefer to work on the web based interface with all of the search functionality that makes it easy to find just the right message when I need it. I hope the server comes back up again soon.

_Also before some jerk calls me a fool and tells me that I&#8217;m screwing up with my urls, it&#8217;s not just me, None of my coworkers are able to get on GMail, neither can my wife (who is not here), nor several friends online. A Simple [Date Based Google Blog Search](http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?q=gmail+502&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&um=1&as_maxm=8&as_miny=2008&as_maxy=2008&as_minm=8&as_mind=11&as_maxd=11&as_drrb=b&ctz=420&c1cr=8%2F11%2F2008&c2cr=8%2F11%2F2008&btnD=Go) shows that many other people are experiencing problems with 502 errors on the GMail interface today_

**Update:** After getting everything operational again, Google [Blogged about the outage, apologizing for the inconvenience](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/08/we-feel-your-pain-and-were-sorry.html).
