Several months ago I got a [Fitbit](http://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Wireless-Personal-Trainer/dp/B0031P3HY2%3FSubscriptionId%3D0P20NKJGP78BQ061KR02%26tag%3Dcapslog-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0031P3HY2 "View product details at Amazon") tracker as a prize for a contest.  While I generally dislike exercise (as much as I know I should), I love gadgets, and this thing is as geeky as a pedometer can get (note, the @fitbit folks are very adamant that this is not a pedometer, but it accomplishes the same goals).

I find myself constantly looking at it to see how many steps I&#8217;ve made during the day and checking the flower to see if it is healthy or wilted.

My favorite feature is the activity mode.  When I do actual exercise and I hit the treadmill, I can switch it to activity mode and get down to the minute statistics of how well I did.  I love this tracker and highly recommend it for people who want to track their daily activity.

Here are [some stats](http://www.fitbit.com/user/223FZ9) from tonight&#8217;s walk on the treadmill:
