I was driving to the district office today to do a small job and also help out Angela get her pictures uploaded when I suddenly heard a strange scraping noise. It took me less then a second to realize I either have got a flat tire and am riding the rim, or something has broken off the bottom of the car and is scraping on the ground.

I was just about to pass Discount Tire Company at the time, so I pulled into the parking lot and got out and saw that lo and behold, my front right tire was completely flat. Not being a man of muscle, I called the house to ask for help. David came to my aid, changed the tire with the spare, and escorted me home. I then had to wait for mother to get home (which she showed up an hour and a half later then Dad expected she would) and then drove her car here to get the job done (I&#8217;m still at the District Office uploading pictures to Angela&#8217;s Photo Gallery).

I&#8217;m in a Catch 22 situation (&#8220;I&#8217;m curious, [what is the _etymology_ of that idiom?]({{ $page->postLink("2004-07-28-catch22") }})&#8221;) in that I have to work to get money to pay for new tires, but I cannot get to jobs to work unless I have a car that has tires. Oh well, something will get figured out&#8230;. I hope.
