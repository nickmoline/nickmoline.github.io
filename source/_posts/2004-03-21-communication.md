_Note in May 2006 &#8211; Once again I find an article that has been edited by my ex, I am not sure what was in the beginning of this article before, but I&#8217;m sure it was an article about my trip to Arkansas with the SWD to a Team Leadership Conference.  It was a very nice article about what the conference was about, communicating.  I am quite annoyed to find it removed._  

In other news, this past week I received a letter from Gail Hallman, who is now ERCC&#8217;s Administrative Director now that Jim Cantleberry is having to leave the church, assigning me to clean the church in a specific time-slot, without ever asking me if I was willing or able to serve in this regard

<!--more-->

I wrote her an e-mail yesterday to express this concern

> Greetings Gail,
> 
> I am greatly disturbed by the manner in which this new clean team drafting process is being handled. If you had come to me and said &#8220;Nick, the clean team does not have enough people on it, would you consider joining the team&#8221; I would have considered it, with my other responsibilities, and I probably would have said yes. But you have not given me that option. We are coming off of a series in church called Simplifying LIFE and one of the main tenants in this series has been that we carefully consider taking on new responsibilities in our lives.
> 
> Several separate messages specifically said that we as a people learn to be able to say no and not take on new responsibilities so quickly.
> 
> You know from experience that I greatly enjoy helping the church in any way I can, it gives me great joy to know I&#8217;ve been of help in some way, but I do not appreciate that when there is a need that it be taken for granted that I will help fill that need, and I&#8217;m sure I am not the only one to think this way.
> 
> I have always been happy to stay after an event to help straighten up for the next event, but being told that I must appear at the church on a particular date and help because it&#8217;s the day I&#8217;ve been arbitrarily assigned to without even being asked if I was willing to help in the first place is not right.
> 
> I am disturbed in a broader sense that the church has not even limited this draft to the membership of Eden Road but by your own words &#8220;among all the regular attenders.&#8221; People are being drafted to do a specific task in the church without their consent and they aren&#8217;t even sure they want to be members of the church yet?
> 
> Because of how much this disturbs me I do not feel that I can easily do this task and maintain a mentality of love throughout it. I have therefore decided to exercise the lesson learned in recent teachings at Eden Road and respectfully say No, I cannot take on this task. I will gladly continue to stay after events and help setup for whatever is coming next if possible for me to do so, but I cannot come to the church at 9 o&#8217;clock in the morning on April 17th.
