I mentioned last week that _Pottermore_ is set to open to the public on April 1st, [unless it is a cruel April Fools day joke]({{ $page->postUrl("2012-03-20-pottermore-to-finally-open-up-on-april-1st-unless-its-a-cruel-joke") }} "Pottermore to finally open up on April 1st, unless it’s a cruel joke") to potter fans.  It seems the Pottermore team is hoping to dispel the fears that it might be a joke by <a href="http://insider.pottermore.com/2012/03/harry-potter-ebooks-and-digital-audio.html" target="_blank">releasing</a> part of the site (a part that wasn&#8217;t previously even available to beta users) today!  The <a href="http://shop.pottermore.com/" target="_blank">Pottermore Shop</a>, where we can finally purchase Harry Potter e-books, is now available in the US and Britain (with <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/faq-language" target="_blank" class="broken_link">other regions and languages coming soon</a>).

I do almost all of my reading these days on a Kindle or Kindle related app because I love the portability of it.  It has been extremely annoying for years that my favorite book series isn&#8217;t available on Kindle, because they are the books I&#8217;d most like to have with me at all times.

When I travel, I tend to need to bring several books with me because with all the extra reading time I tend to plow through a few books, and I just can&#8217;t carry the entire Harry Potter series in my carryon, so you can be sure I will be picking up the Complete Harry Potter Collection (for $57.54) very soon.

### The Great:
* Buy once, get both .mobi (Kindle) and .epub versions!
* No DRM Crap to deal with, this will work on every .mobi and .epub reader
* Still supports Whispersync on Kindle even though you aren&#8217;t buying from Amazon!
* Also supports Google Play and Nook
* Audio books also have no DRM, plain .mp3 files!

### The Good:
* <a href="http://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/harry-potter-ebooks?c=USD" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Price for ebooks</a> is good, if not great. (<a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp1-ebook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">SS</a>, <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp2-ebook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">CS</a> and <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp3-ebook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">PA</a> are $7.99 each, <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp4-ebook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">GF</a>, <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp5-ebook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">OotP</a>, <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp6-ebook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">HBP</a> and <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp7-ebook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">DH</a> $9.99 each, or <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hpbundle1-7-ebook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the whole set</a> $57.54)
* Audio books are cheaper than the CD versions previously available
* Store is easy to use and purchase

### The NOT so Good:
* Audio books are still <a href="http://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/harry-potter-audio-books?c=USD" target="_blank" class="broken_link">way too expensive</a> (<a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp1-audiobook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">SS</a>, <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp2-audiobook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">CS</a> and <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp3-audiobook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">PA</a> are $29.99 each, <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp4-audiobook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">GF</a>, <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp5-audiobook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">OotP</a>, <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp6-audiobook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">HBP</a> and <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hp7-audiobook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">DH</a> $44.99 each, or <a href="https://shop.pottermore.com/en_US/hpbundle1-7-audiobook-english-us1-usd" target="_blank" class="broken_link">the whole set</a> for a whopping $242.94)
* I can&#8217;t buy the books on Amazon (or with my kindle directly) or on iTunes, kinda not very friendly to people who are used to buying that way.
* It won&#8217;t let me buy the British editions, even though I prefer them (Actually being familiar with Alchemy, I&#8217;ve always preferred to read &#8220;Philosopher&#8217;s Stone&#8221; to &#8220;Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone&#8221;)
