Well, I&#8217;ve registered to return to school next semester, inside you will find my class schedule for the Spring Semester as it stands, I may decide to edit this, but for now this is accurate.

This accounts for a total of 12 semester hours, which gives me full time status, thus allowing me to get back on mom&#8217;s flight benefits.

You may also notice that every class is Tuesday/Thursday, this gives me Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to do consulting if I have any consulting jobs to do. Also, since I&#8217;ll have flight benefits again, this gives me the ability to travel more flexibly, as it will give me a 4 day weekend every weekend, Friday through Monday as far as school commitments are concerned, so I can do weekend trips.

School starts on <time datetime="2005-01-18">January 18th</time>
