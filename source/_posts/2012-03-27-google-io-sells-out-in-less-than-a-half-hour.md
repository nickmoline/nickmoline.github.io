Even though Google doubled the price (paid $450 last year, this year $900), Google I/O sold out even faster than last year.  Last year it took about 45 minutes for Google&#8217;s Developer conference to sell out, this year it was all over in just over 20 minutes according to a <a href="https://plus.google.com/107117483540235115863/posts/iyc4arLjidR" target="_blank">post on Google+ by Google VP Vic Gundotra</a>.

I&#8217;m glad to say I [will be at I/O]({% post_url 2012-03-13-google-io-2012-here-i-come %} "Google I/O 2012 Here I come") this year once again, but all but one of my colleagues who tried to buy tickets were unable to acquire them.  Will I see you at Google I/O?
