It&#8217;s midnight, it is now officially the day of surgery, and the latest phase takes effect, as of this moment, nothing more to drink (or eat, though I haven&#8217;t been allowed to eat in weeks anyway) until after the surgery, even water.

Surgery is tomorrow at 10 am Pacific time (just 10 hours away).
