It has been a very long week.

I was running the A/V system for the annual district conference of the Southwestern District of the C&MA, long days but a lot of fun overall.

Then Friday I took a quick trip out to TN to meet with D, a most enjoyable if sadly short encounter, flew there Friday afternoon, met her in the evening, and flew home Saturday morning.

Went to the movie theater last night and saw _The Fighting Temptations_, was pretty good but I felt a bit out of place as I was the only white guy in the theater, although there were several white guys in the film. The movie itself was good and the music was fun, although I don't generally listen to Gospel style music, it's fun every once in a while and it was fun to see a movie with a decent story and a family friendly environment. So give it a try.

This morning I felt quite sick with the flu so I didn't go to church, more for being worried that I would infect the congregation then for my own purposes, so I spent most of today playing **Warcraft III** and then editing some **ACTD** transcripts for the _Artemis_.

That's about all for tonight I guess, _TTFN_
