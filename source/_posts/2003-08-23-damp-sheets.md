oh look 5 a.m., I had washed my sheets last night and then I forgot to put them in the dryer so at 3:30 when I realized I wanted to go to bed, I didn't have any sheets, so I put them in the dryer and then chatted online for a while and then wrote another chapter of my FanFic (_Miles Apart_), I had meant this chapter 12 to be my last, but I was writing and it ended up longer then any of my previous chapters and I wasn't ready to end yet, so I ended it at a logical place and will write a chapter 13, not sure if that will wrap it up either, but it might.

Anyway it's been a week since I last posted, I've had a crummy work week, a really crummy one.

<!--more-->

Monday I went in and my boss was being a complete <abbr title="ass">....</abbr> about the web-hosting server, first we're condensing 2 servers to 1 even though he said he'd get the 2nd and did not, then he comes up with this &#8220;I want you to turn off the spam and virus filters because I don't like it that one of my messages got caught by mistake and you had access to get it back&#8221; and I was like &#8220;would you rather the message gotten lost forever?&#8221; but is all up on some privacy kick so I removed the virus and spam filters, but because of the way they were set up it was all or nothing, I couldn't just remove it from his account, I had to remove it from ALL accounts so now I get a ridiculous amount of spam. Then he's also had this box he's wanted me to work on that I always had a hunch was going to be a lot of work for no pay and he had wanted me to just get paid from what he charges the client, I ended up working on that box ALL WEEK LONG and still to no avail, the box is still not ready, it's driving me nuts!

It has been the work week from hell, and yet my online friends are telling me I need to work more hours, I can't stand working too many hours with him, he questions every single hour I put on my timecard, he gives me ridiculous tasks, and he thinks he's doing me a favor in all of it! I can't stand it anymore.

What's worse is this is my only avenue to vent this stuff and I have this fear that he is going to see this blog one day and get pissed at me and I'll have burned a bridge without wanting to.

Anyway it's been the whole week from hell except for Wednesday and Friday, Wednesday work was murder but when I got home me and Dad went online (after watching an _Enterprise_ double feature which I enjoyed cause it was like the first time I've sat down and watched an episode of trek with him where he seemed to be enjoying it) and specced out my new laptop computer at dell.com and ordered it so it should be coming next week, of course after doing all that I picked up the newspaper on Thursday and there was an announcement &#8220;Effective today, Dell is dropping their prices on most of their merchandise!&#8221; which included their line of laptops but that's ok, I'm still getting a nice laptop at a decent price and I'll be able to work more efficiently, instead of waiting till the middle of the night to use my dad's computer like I am now.

Today (Friday, not the 5 hours between midnight and now) was fun, I went to Frys to purchase some parts to upgrade a server for my friend JMac, and then my entire family went to **[Medieval Times](http://www.medievaltimes.com/)** to celebrate my little brother's 18th birthday which was today.

Medieval Times was a blast, David was &#8220;knighted&#8221; and got a souvenir photo, the meal was great (and where else can you pay high prices and then eat messily with your hands on dented metal plates), and the entertainment was an absolute blast. We were in the front row of the Yellow section and had an excellent view of the stadium. I highly recommend you go to one of these places if you ever get the opportunity, it is an absolute blast

So I may write more later but now I'm exhausted as it is now 5:30 a.m. and I've been up all night, so good night all.
