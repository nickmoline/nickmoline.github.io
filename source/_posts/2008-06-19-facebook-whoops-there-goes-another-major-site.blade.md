Two weeks ago [I posted about Amazon.com being down for hours]({{ $page->postLink("2008-06-06-amazon-down-but-not-out") }}), tonight, another major website has gone down without warning, and has a very ugly error message, just like Amazon did. At this time the error message (shown on the right) has been up for at least 20 minutes with no sign of repair, in fact, much the contrary, while the error message is still there, it is taking longer and longer for the error message to load, meaning that even facebook&#8217;s error page is under serious strain.

**UPDATE:** Update, the error message is still there, but at least facebook seems to have fixed their CSS, so as you can see to the left, the error message is much less &#8220;ugly&#8221; now.

Interesting a large outage like this happens on the evening of the day that [it is announced that Facebook is losing long time Executive Matt Cohler to Benchmark Capital](https://www.businessinsider.com/2008/6/facebook-loses-long-time-exec)

**Update 2:** It appears that facebook is now operational once again.
