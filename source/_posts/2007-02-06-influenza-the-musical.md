I&#8217;ve been bedridden for days with the flu and it&#8217;s driving me bonkers. A few years ago I would occasionally watch the show _Even Stevens_ on the Disney Channel and I&#8217;m reminded of the episode entitled &#8220;_Influenza, the Musical_&#8221; as I lay in my bed coughing. At least everyone around me doesn&#8217;t spontaneously break into song for no reason.

Oh how I hope this flu goes away soon.
