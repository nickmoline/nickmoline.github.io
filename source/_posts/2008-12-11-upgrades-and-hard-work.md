I recently migrated nick.pro and other sites from regulus over to a new server named Atlas, it&#8217;s much more powerful, but there were some hiccups in the transfer that I&#8217;m slowly having to iron out.

I also just upgraded WordPress to the new 2.7, and I must say, I&#8217;m not a big fan of the all grey interface, but I&#8217;m liking some of the new features, for example the QuickPress block on the Dashboard that let me write this post without having to leave the dashboard at all.

I&#8217;ve been working a lot of extra hours as of late in order to put new things live on Justia, and it&#8217;s had a few negative side effects. Last Wednesday night I was up all night working on things for Justia and then only got an hour and a half of sleep before having to get up Thursday for another day. Unfortunately that hour and a half was obviously not enough, because I fell asleep in the shower and crumbled to the floor of the bathtub, bashing my knee against the metal soap dish, and then on the floor of the tub hard before jolting myself awake.

The doctor said I mildly dislocated my patella and sprained one of the ligaments that connects the bones down there. All throughout the past weekend up until today I&#8217;ve had to walk with a cane to keep the pressure off my knee.

Last night I had another all-niter of work, but fortunately didn&#8217;t injure myself again, tonight it&#8217;s 2:20 a.m. as I write this and I&#8217;m about to go to bed, so there&#8217;s a little rest for the weary, but it&#8217;s worth it. Tonight I pushed some significant improvements to a Justia site, which I might blog about later.
