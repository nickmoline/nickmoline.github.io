Went down to the apple store with [Tim](http://www.timstanley.com) to check out the new iPhone 3G that was released today. But even at 6:30 p.m. (the phone had already been on sale for 10 and a half hours), the line was still stretched all the way around the Apple Store. I&#8217;m going to wait and hopefully pick one up next week when I don&#8217;t have to wait quite so long to get one. The line was so long NBC News was there interviewing people waiting in line. (note the news van on the left of the image)
