I revisit my blog after a busy May, 2011 including going to Google I/O 2011 and what do I see as the last post on my blog, a short stinger post about Google I/O 2010. This simply won&#8217;t do.

I&#8217;ve written other blog posts in the last year, they just haven&#8217;t been on my own blog. I&#8217;ve written a [number of blog posts](http://onward.justia.com/author/nickmoline/) in the last year on [Justia&#8217;s Law, Technology and Legal Marketing Blog](http://onward.justia.com/). I&#8217;m well past due however writing blog posts for myself. I will make an effort to pick back up on this as it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always enjoyed.

I&#8217;ll begin with some general updates. Two blog posts ago (March, 2010) I was blogging about making a difficult decision regarding looking into adopting a child. While we did look into pursuing that angle, sadly the mother of the child in question changed her mind and decided to keep the child herself. We haven&#8217;t given up hope of having a child someday (hopefully not too far in the distant future) but sadly God has other plans for us right now it seems.

I have been incredibly busy with work over the least year and I love working for Justia. We&#8217;ve put out some great projects in that time including [Justia Legal Answers](http://answers.justia.com/) which I had the privilege of [writing about on the Justia Blog](http://onward.justia.com/2010/11/09/announcing-justia-answers/) and [Justia Daily Opinion Summaries](http://onward.justia.com/2011/04/19/announcing-justia-daily-opinion-summaries/) which was part of a revamp of our [Justia Law Center](http://law.justia.com/). More projects are, as always, underway and I look forward to pushing out some great new features in the upcoming days.

In my personal life, I&#8217;ve gotten to do quite a lot of exciting things this year, which I&#8217;m going to try to write separate posts for. Going to Disney World for the first time and visiting the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in the process, Going on my first Cruise, Visiting New York City (3 Times!) and getting my first (and second) taste of Broadway and Time Square.
