Even though my blog is self hosted, I like many wordpress users use wordpress.com stats from the Jetpack plugin.

This year, the great people at WordPress.com decided to create some really great looking <a href="http://jetpack.me/annual-report/1079684/2011/" target="_blank">Annual Reports</a> for blogs using wordpress.com stats.

In 2011 I wrote only 12 posts, which is really pathetic, but nowhere near as bad as 2010 where I posted a whopping 3 posts. I resolve in 2012 to write more often.

My most popular post of the year? [Pottermore Cheats: Earning more house points through failure then success in potion making]({{ $page->postUrl("2011-08-27-pottermore-cheats-earning-more-house-points-through-failure-then-success-in-potion-making") }}/) where I outlined the flaws evident in the Potions system on Pottermore, which have since been fixed as I mentioned in my [second most popular post of the year]({{ $page->postUrl("2011-09-14-pottermore-cheats-potions-better-still-needs-more") }}).

Check out Jetpack.me&#8217;s full <a href="http://jetpack.me/annual-report/1079684/2011/" target="_blank">2011 year in blogging on nick.pro</a> report.
