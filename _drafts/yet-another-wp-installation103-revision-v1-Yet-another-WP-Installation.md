I&#8217;m on a roll with installations of WP Blogs, I&#8217;ve now set one up for <a title="Serenity's Thoughts" target="_blank" href="http://www.barbara.pro/" rel="noopener">my girlfriend</a> so that she has a site of her own. It&#8217;s a simple header/footer, though I think she&#8217;ll like it. I&#8217;ll have to come up with a better background color then the blue/black gradient, It doesn&#8217;t mesh well with the rose. Still, I&#8217;ve been having a good time with them. Go check out her site.
