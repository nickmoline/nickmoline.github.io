I've been trying to think how to write this post for a very long time, years in fact.  I've written dozens of drafts, I've considered multiple mediums, but my cowardice has prevented me from publishing it.  From short posts to facebook, to lengthy blog posts, I've tried to come up with ways to say this for ages, and every time I do, I chicken out.

For almost everyone in my audience, this will come as a surprise, but for completely different reasons.  For those of you who have known me the longest (family, school classmates, church members), you'll be shocked that I've made such a radical change.  For those of you who know me well for the last several years (coworkers, theatre friends), you will probably be more shocked that there is a change at all, because what I previously was, doesn't jive with the way I treat you and others.

Enough waffling Nick, I'll get to the point.  I no longer consider myself an Evangelical Christian.

## What I believed

For most of my life, I was a born again Christian.  I believed in the Bible as unfallable truth, and I believed that salvation is a gift from God, which he gave through his son Jesus.  I diligently studied the Bible, read it cover-to-cover multiple times.  I volunteered at churches, I went to a Christian private school.  I went on spiritual retreats, donated to missionaries.  I would only listen to christian music and christian talk-shows.  I even tied my career to my faith for a while, I worked as an employee at my church for a few years, and there was a period of time I strongly considered going into the ministry and becoming a pastor.  I was sold, hook-line-sinker.

I even believed the messages Christians have about what is "wrong with the world."  I believed sex outside of marriage was a sin, I believed that homosexuality was a sin.  I believed marriage was between 1 man and 1 woman, and I believed that abortion was murder.  I believed that the liberals were out to take our Bibles away and I believed that God made you a certain way, that whatever gender you had when God made you was the perfect and right choice and that if your gender identity didn't match your biological sex that you were mentally ill and needed Jesus in your life.  I believed all of those things, but I was never comfortable about how we treated people that disagreed with us.

## What I still believe in: Jesus' teachings

Even to this day, I have no problem with the teachings of Jesus.  Jesus taught extensively about love and acceptance of others.  He sought out and spent time with those who were despised by the Religious Right of the day.  Prostitutes, Tax Collectors, Samaritans, these were the people Jesus chose to spend time with.  Priests who spoke out against others, those were the ones he shunned and spoke out against.

When asked what was most important he listed only 2 things, Love the Lord, and Love your Neighbor as yourself.  See this is the problem I have with the evangelical church today.  When asked how to prioritize the law, Jesus prioritized love above all else.  He truly lived and preached the Golden Rule.  When people were ganging up to stone a woman for adultary (note, where was the man she was committing adultary with, nobody seemed to want to stone that person) Jesus asked that he who has no sin in his life should cast the first stone.

Jesus tought that you have no right to judge others, he said:

> Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, "Let me take the speck out of your eye," when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye. -- [Matthew 7:3-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A3-5&version=NIV)

### Love for your enemies

"Love your neighbor as yourself," ([Mark 12:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12%3A31&version=NIV)) or "Do to others as you would have them do to you" ([Luke 6:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6%3A31&version=NIV)), 2000 years later, why is this such a radical concept to those who claim to follow Jesus.

Let's expand that Luke 6 quote a bit more.

> But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them. Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. Do to others as you would have them do to you.
> If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that. And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. -- [Luke 6:27-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6%3A27-35&version=NIV)

What Jesus is teaching here is simple ethics and morals.  If everyone treated others the way they wanted to be treated, there would be no conflict, there would be no war, and there certainly wouldn't be trying to rewind the clock back to a point that people "owned" other people as slaves.  If you don't think you support that but you fly a Confederate flag, guess what, you support that!  

## Things "Christians" believe that I cannot support

### LGBTQIA+

I am 100% an LGBTQIA+ Ally!  All of them!  These people have a right to exist, they have a right to love who they love, be who they are, and live their true authentic lives.  They have a right to be treated as fairly as anyone else!  Just as heterosexuals have a right to love people of the opposite sex, Gays have the right to love people of the same sex.  Just because you aren't gay, doesn't mean you have any right to prevent anyone else from being gay.

And it isn't just the gays I support, let me be perfectly clear.  Trans men are men, Trans women are women, and they have a right to be treated as such.  Nonbinary people have the right to be neither, both, or any combination.

To my trans friends (and I have many), I love you all, and I respect who you are.

I cannot support people who read the Bible and interpret it that the queer community should be persecuted.  I do not believe it.  Queer people are some of the most loving people I've ever met.  Heck, I'll go out on a limb right now and say basically every Queer person I've ever met has been more loving, more accepting of others, more peaceful, more Christlike than the overwhelming majority of Evangelical Christians I know.

### Sexism

While we are on the topic of people who aren't heterosexuals, let's take this a step further.  Men are not superior to women.  If anything I'd flip it around and say women are superior to men in many ways.  It is time we stop treating women with disrespect, and start treating them as equals.

I do not consider myself superior to any woman.  I've had no problems having female bosses, and now that I'm in a position of authority I don't treat men who report to me as better in any way than females who report to me.  And I sincerely hope I didn't get this position of authority because I'm a cis white man, but I regretfully accept that to a certain extent that is likely true.  

Because I'm a cis white man I've had unfair advantages throughout my life.  Advantages over women, advantages over queer people, advantages over people of color.  I should not have had any of those advantages, it is not fair, and I will do everything in my power to not give cis white men any advantages over anyone else.

### Racism

Here's an interesting bit of knowledge for you that most white people don't seem to pay attention to.  Jesus wasn't white.  He was Jewish, he was a middle easterner.  Racism is ridiculous.  Note I'm not saying that the idea that racism exists is ridiculous, I'm saying racists are ridiculous.  What difference is there between a white man and a black man that makes you think the white man is superior to the black man.  What makes you look at asian woman and think a white man is superior to her.  White people are not superior to anyone.  The only way they ever were superior in any way is that the white people took that power by force, and it was morally, ethically, and even spiritually wrong.

People who believe that everyone should be treated the way they would want to be treated shouldn't be trying to defend the acts of Chauvin who brutally murdered George Floyd by suffocating him, just because of the color of his skin.  People who believe that everyone should be treated the way they would want to be treated shouldn't be supporting a corrupt justice system in America that has always treated minorities as less than human, disproportionally prosecuting people of color more than white people even though there is no statistical difference in the number of crimes committed.

> Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. "Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!" -- Statue of Liberty Dedication Plaque

America was built by immagrants.  White people are not native to these shores, and we used to call this country the great "Melting Pot" proud of the fact that we were built by people of many different cultures coming together.  True our history has **always** been racist, and persecuted people, but at least the ideal was that we accept people with open arms.  So why are we trying to build an ill-conceived wall to keep out our neighbors?

### On a related note... Nazis

This is something I just can't understand.  My whole life I was told that the holocost was a tradgedy and that the Nazi's were evil.  I thought everyone accepted that at this point.  Even pop culture pushes this, why do we like Steve Rogers?  Cause he is against Nazis!  Why do we like Indiana Jones?  Because he prevented the Nazis from getting priceless relics.

So how in the world could there be people who claim to be followers of Christ marching through the streets wearing T-Shirts that say things like "[6MWE](https://www.adl.org/resources/blog/proud-boys-bigotry-full-display)" and shouting things like "The Jews will not replace us!"  These people not only look at the history of Nazi Germany and not only think "Nazi = Good" but they actually believe the only thing that the Nazi's did wrong was that they didn't manage to kill more than 6 million Jews.  This makes no sense, the Jews are God's "chosen people" after all.

## Other things I don't believe

I will be writing a followup post about other things that Christians believe that I do not believe anymore.  Some of these will be really hot takes, but I wanted to focus this article on treating people with respect and love, because I believe everyone deserves the chance to live their life with dignity.
