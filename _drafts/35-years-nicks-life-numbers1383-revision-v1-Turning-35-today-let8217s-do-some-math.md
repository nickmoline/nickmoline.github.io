Today, August 10th, is my 35th birthday.  I have to say this is the first birthday where I&#8217;ve actually felt &#8220;old.&#8221;  I realize the many friends I have who are older than me probably think that is silly, but to me this seems like a real benchmark year.  It makes me feel like I should come up with some numbers to quantify my life.

## Where I&#8217;ve Lived

Of the 12,785 days I&#8217;ve lived on this planet, I&#8217;ve lived in the following states:

&nbsp;

  * California: 7,484 days* (58.537%)
  * Texas: 2,967 days* (23.207%)
  * Florida: 182 days* (1.423%)
  * Virginia: 1,957 days (15.307%)
  * North Carolina: 194 days (1.517%)

<small><em>* Slight note, when I was very young I spent 6 months each in Texas and Florida.  Since I do not have the precise move in and out days for those locations, I&#8217;m estimating under the assumption that I spent half a year in each location (182 days, giving the extra 1 day back to California).  I likely did not spend exactly 182 days in each of Florida and Texas, so the exact number of days for California, Texas and Florida may be slightly off. I also am trying to order this by the order of first time living there, I&#8217;m not sure if I lived in Texas first or Florida.<br /> If my parents know more precisely, I&#8217;ll update these figures accordingly.</em></small>

By far the longest of these locations is California at 58% of my life, or just under 20 and a half years.
