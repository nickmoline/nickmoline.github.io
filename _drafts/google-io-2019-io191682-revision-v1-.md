On May 7-9, 2019, Google held the twelfth annual Google I/O Developer Conference, and for the twelfth time (plus the original Google Developer Day in 2007), I attended with my wife Barbara. Four years ago in 2016, Google moved the conference from [Moscone Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscone_Center) in San Francisco to the [Shoreline Amphitheatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoreline_Amphitheatre) in Mountain View (just down the street from both the [Googleplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googleplex) and Justia&#8217;s Mountain View Headquarters), and changed the feel of the conference to give it more of a music festival vibe. This year&#8217;s conference continued the theme of Google&#8217;s recent focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in particular, but also had a strong emphasis on trying to inspire developers. 

## This Year&#8217;s Big Announcements

Google used this year&#8217;s conference to announce 2 new phones, the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL. These cheaper versions of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL they released back in the fall pack in as much of the Pixel functionality as they can at nearly half the price of their flagship devices. The advancements of Google&#8217;s Machine Learning were front and center with features like on-device Live Captioning at the operating system level in Android Q, improvements to the functionality of Google Lens to aid users of different levels of literacy to interact with the world, and the ability to automatically fill in multi-step forms on the web with Duplex for the Web. Google also used this conference to rebrand Google Home devices under the Nest brand name (while at the same time ending several of the Nest specific projects such as &#8220;Works with Nest&#8221; in favor of the Google Home integration points). While it wasn&#8217;t announced on the main stage, a big change announced at Google I/O of interest to us at Justia, and to the web marketing industry as a whole, is that Google&#8217;s search engine spider, [Googlebot, is now &#8220;Evergreen.&#8221;](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/05/the-new-evergreen-googlebot.html) Until recently, Googlebot was based on an older version of the Chrome rendering engine (Chrome 41).&nbsp; Websites using technologies that didn&#8217;t work in Chrome 41 could have issues getting indexed properly in Google. Now Googlebot is based on the latest open source stable version of Chromium (Chrome 74 at the time of the announcement), and when new stable versions of Chromium are released in the future, Googlebot will update to the new version within weeks of release. 

## Justia Live Blogs

While I attended a large variety of sessions, I&#8217;ve continued the tradition I started 2 years ago by live blogging 7 of the sessions I attended which I thought are of particular interest to those of us interested in marketing on the web.&nbsp; This year&#8217;s live blogged sessions were: 

  1. [Building Successful Websites: Case Studies for Mature and Emerging Markets](https://onward.justia.com/2019/05/07/building-successful-websites-case-studies-for-mature-and-emerging-markets-io19-live-blogs/)
  2. [Enhance Your Search and Assistant Presence with Structured Data](https://onward.justia.com/2019/05/08/enhance-your-search-and-assistant-presence-with-structured-data-io19-live-blogs/)
  3. [Rapidly Building Better Web Experiences with AMP](https://onward.justia.com/2019/05/08/rapidly-building-better-web-experiences-with-amp-io19-live-blogs/)
  4. [Speed at Scale: Web Performance Tips and Tricks from the Trenches](https://onward.justia.com/2019/05/08/speed-at-scale-web-performance-tips-and-tricks-from-the-trenches-io19-live-blogs/)
  5. [Google Search: State of the Union](https://onward.justia.com/2019/05/09/google-search-state-of-the-union-io19-live-blogs/)
  6. [AMP for Email: Coming Soon to an Inbox Near You](https://onward.justia.com/2019/05/09/amp-for-email-coming-soon-to-an-inbox-near-you/)
  7. [Google Search and JavaScript Sites](https://onward.justia.com/2019/05/09/google-search-and-javascript-sites-io19-live-blogs/)

We hope you joined us for the live blogs, or at least that you find the archives of our live blogs as interesting as I found the sessions I was live blogging. 

## Other Interesting Sessions

As I mentioned, I attended other sessions as well. I was especially surprised by the number of sessions I attended that were not sessions evangelizing Google APIs and services, but instead were meant to inspire developers to change the world in the future.  Here are the four of the ones that I found the most inspiring: <figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

**Teaching a Car to Drive Itself by Imitation and Imagination** was a session hosted by Mayank Bansal of [Waymo](https://waymo.com/), formerly known as the &#8220;Google Self Driving Car Project.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect from this session, but I wasn&#8217;t expecting the session to be a deep dive explaining the process that the Waymo team followed to train the machine learning models that allow their self driving cars to work. He explained the pitfalls that the team came across when doing the project and didn&#8217;t shy away from the ways the team failed in their early attempts. This was an absolutely fascinating session, and extremely inspiring. <figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

  <span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"></span>
</div></figure> 

**Stadia Streaming Tech: A Deep Dive**. This session pleasantly surprised me, as well. [Stadia](https://store.google.com/us/magazine/stadia?hl=en-US) is Google&#8217;s new Streaming Gaming product that will come out later this year (announced back at the Game Developer Conference earlier this year). I thought it might be aimed at game developers wanting to develop for the service, but instead the session was a deep dive into streaming technology as a whole and just how they changed the way streaming video works to reduce latency as much as possible. It went into the fundamentals of how streaming has worked historically and how they have changed it. <figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

**On Creativity and Technology, with Legendary Animator Glen Keane **was a very personal report from former Disney animator [Glen Keane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Keane), explaining how someone most known for using a pencil and paper to create characters such as Ariel (from _The Little Mermaid_) and the Beast (from _Beauty and the Beast_) could learn to embrace technology and demonstrating how technology fosters creativity. The session was deeply moving, and it was powerful just being in the same room as this incredibly creative individual. <figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure> 

Sessions don&#8217;t get any more inspiring than **Michio Kaku on the Future of Humanity**. [Kaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku) is the co-founder of String Field Theory and one of the most intelligent people in the world. This interview and Q&A session left everyone in the room thinking about what the future holds, not just with technology, but with the mind, education, and more. 

## Final Thoughts

Google I/O is a high point of my year, every year for the last 13 years (12 Google I/O conferences, and Google Developer Day before it). I look forward to it the entire year and I show my excitement for it by doing crazy things like coloring my hair and painting my face (this year I didn&#8217;t paint my face but my wife did). 

This year&#8217;s conference felt different from recent years past. Yes, I still got sun burned in spite of tons of sunscreen. Yes, I still ended each day so exhausted that I could barely walk to my bedroom before collapsing to sleep at night. But it has been a long time since I&#8217;ve left Google I/O feeling so inspired to make great things, to push the future of technology, and to follow that great adage:

Never give up, whether you are working on making the law free and accessible to all like we do at Justia, pushing the limits of creativity and animation like Glen Keane, teaching a car to drive itself like Waymo, or trying to solve the greatest mysteries of the universe like Michio Kaku. Keep moving forward.
