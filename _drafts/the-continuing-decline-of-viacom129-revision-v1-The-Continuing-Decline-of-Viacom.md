I&#8217;ve long been disillusioned with Viacom and it&#8217;s child companies, especially after CBS/UPN canceled such great shows as Enterprise and Joan of Arcadia, despite massive Fan support. Today, Viacom proves yet again that it doesn&#8217;t care about the interest of it&#8217;s viewers, <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/03/13/ap3513198.html">Viacom has filed a lawsuit against Google for $1 billion dollars</span>. The story goes, that according to Viacom, over a hundred thousand Viacom copyrighted materials have been viewed on Google owned YouTube over a million and a half times. The problem with Viacom&#8217;s claim though is that they believe it is Google&#8217;s fault for allowing the clips to be uploaded in the first place. YouTube wouldn&#8217;t work if it weren&#8217;t for allowing clips to be uploaded, and <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=58127" target="_blank">YouTube has long had a mechanism in place where if a copyright owner complains, they will pull down the copyrighted content quickly</a>.

I decided to look up the lawsuit to see the information on this suit is available. I did a <a href="http://dockets.justia.com/search?query=Viacom" target="_blank">Search for Viacom</a> on <a href="http://dockets.justia.com/" target="_blank">Justia Federal Court Filings and Dockets</a>, and found <a href="http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-nysdce/case_no-1:2007cv02103/case_id-302164/" target="_blank">Viacom International, Inc. et al v. Youtube, Inc. et al</a>, case 1:2007cv02103, filed March 13th, 2007 in the New York Southern Federal District Court, Foley Square Office.
