Amazon has a great deal on an Aukey USB-C charger that supports Power Delivery (i.e. can actually charge a laptop). Â [Click Here and use promo code AUPOWER1](http://amzn.to/2uH17tz) during checkout to get it for $54

Logitech&#8217;s Harmony has long been the standard for macro based device control, and Amazon&#8217;s got a great deal on a Remote + Hub (so you can use your phone or IFTTT or Google Home) for just $69.99
