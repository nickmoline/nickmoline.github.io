As many of my friends know, I am a huge Disney Fan.  A year and a half ago, on a trip to Disneyland with my wife and Brother-in-law I went through the line queue at <a title="Space Mountain - Tomorrowland - Disneyland" href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/space-mountain/" target="_blank">Space Mountain</a> and attempted to get into the ride vehicle.  Sadly, I couldn&#8217;t even sit down, let alone pull down the lap bar, and I was forced to get off the ride and wait while they enjoyed it without me.

Later that trip in July of 2011, at Disney California Adventure, I attempted to ride California Screamin&#8217; only to once again sadly have to wait while they enjoyed themselves without me.

As those of you who follow my blog know, I&#8217;ve lost a lot of weight since that trip.  On Tuesday, December 11th, I went in for my monthly weigh in and I was **339.6 pounds**.  This is a total of **150.6** **pounds lost!**

Friday, December 14th, 2012 My wife and I went to Disneyland again, and the first thing I did that Friday morning is make a bee-line for Space Mountain.  I&#8217;m happy to report that the weight loss was enough, I was successfully able to ride Space Mountain, and the proof is above.

The next day, December 15th, 2012, we had a great time at Disney California Adventure, and like before I made it my goal to ride California Screamin&#8217;.  I&#8217;m happy to report that once again I was successful and I was able to ride it as well.

Both rides were fantastic (in fact Space Mountain seemed even better than I remember from my childhood) and were a great encouragement to me that my weight-loss efforts are working.
